Of course, making progress getting through books has also sparked a book acquisition spree… it remains to be seen if I will keep up the pace or be overwhelmed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;My books of summer 2019 and why&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;China&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China plays a huge role in global affairs, and will continue to do so for the rest of the 21st century. I want to continue adding to my understanding and impressions of this huge entity. I have already wolfed down two of Ma Jian’s brutal dissident fictions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2IvaLJd&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Road&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2DkAIac&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beijing Coma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Hoping to round out those brillant, dark, and desperate reflections of the brutality of modern China with these next three works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZdcAjc&quot;&gt;Wolf Totem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZkMAmb&quot;&gt;China’s New Confucianism: Politics and Everyday Life in a Changing Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Empire, history and “Civilization”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world as we know it today has been shaped by countless events and moments in history. However we perceive or understand different places and societies today, one can almost always peel off another layer and discover the deeper lines and forces at play. These books represent the current smattering of works in that vein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Masculinity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron John&lt;/em&gt; has been recommended to me by a friend, in conversation about his men’s reading group and my youth group experiences. Seems like it is one of the classic reads on masculinity, I’ll be curious to see how it translates to today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Society, community and belonging&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four books represent different facets of how humans come together and interact. &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZmmWxm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liars and Outliers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is actually going to be a re-read. I read it when it first came out. I’ll probably take the time over summer to write up a review/prior on some of the key concepts from it that I have held on to over these years. &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2DhRg2z&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; popped up as a good option for complex systems thinking and seeing the common patterns that pop up in various systems. Good general prep for the &lt;a href=&quot;www.twicefire.com/summerschool&quot;&gt;sustainability summer school&lt;/a&gt; I’m heading to in July. &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZmyUHp&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Art of Gathering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will hopefully yield some gems on how to cultivate and grow community. And &lt;em&gt;Towards Self-sufficiency&lt;/em&gt; attempts to map out a model for resilient communities, ready to survive the coming ‘transition’ as the global economy and ecology collapses; Cheery stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZmmWxm&quot;&gt;Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust that Society Needs to Thrive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is to get through all of these before the end of summer! Wish me luck, and if you are inspired to check any of these books out, I would love to hear your perspectives on them!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kiss of Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[Look at the sky Its the color of love Look at the sky Its the color of love You gave me the kiss of life Kiss of life You gave me the kisses…]]></description><link>https://twicefire.com/kissoflife/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://twicefire.com/kissoflife/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2019 23:46:37 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: An old mentor recommended this book to me. It overlaps with much of my work and learnings with Stepping Stones but also comes with a strong Australian flavour. I feel strongly about the topics touched on in the book but recognize I have much to learn about the work and different angles being taken around it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are men who wake up in the morning energised and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose partners and children love and trust them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who do work they believe in and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have loyal and interesting friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And are deeply involved in the wider world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may not be famous or wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They value something quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are learning how to be real.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First published in 1994, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GZ56VY7/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;#x26;camp=1789&amp;#x26;creative=9325&amp;#x26;creativeASIN=B07GZ56VY7&amp;#x26;linkCode=as2&amp;#x26;tag=twicefire-20&amp;#x26;linkId=70a465d2c0eefab8010391427ce66413&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Manhood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (back then just &lt;em&gt;Manhood&lt;/em&gt;) and Steve Biddulph’s consistent touring and writing have touched the lives of countless men in Australia. Steve begins the book with an anecdote tinged with an quintessential Australian male flavour. Steve describes experiencing the tension and flutter of the moments before public speaking. He pops into the foyer, to smooth some of his nerves by chatting and being with some of the folk coming to listen to his talk. He notices a fellow intently staring at him; a big muscular, tattooed bloke, in a singlet top and with a beard for good measure. As this man noticed Steve noticing him, he gathers his two companions and strides purposefully up to Steve, stopping within inches of Steve’s face. Frowning, the man speaks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You been following me around?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve understandably is confounded by this confrontational tack and breathlessly mouths a non-reply before the man puts him out of his misery; breaking into a wide grin, the man continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That bloody book of yours - that’s the story of my life, mate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension broken, the man goes on to introduce his brother and father, and explains how they had barely spoken for years until he had read &lt;em&gt;Manhood&lt;/em&gt;, sent copies to them and then they had collectively ‘sorted it out’. Its a beautiful, tangible moment for Steve and some of the men he has helped heal. It is also deeply powerful for me, feeling the dry Australian humour of how the man approached Steve (and my nostalgic yearning for such humour) but more so hearing about how this man and his family-men, very ‘blokey’ embodiments of Australian masculinity, had been reached by Steve Biddulph’s work. This gives me hope, assaying one of my fears around contemporary work on masculinity; that it can come off as unaccessible and completely alien to lots of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Manhood&lt;/em&gt; (updated twice more since 1994) rolls on from there. Biddulph defines the challenge men face today, and methodically works through the different arenas of family, love, work and meaning that is bound up in it all. For this review, I want to focus on a couple of key areas that either stood out for me or are connected to the rites of passage work I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The River of Masculinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While delving into the challenge faced by contemporary masculinity, Biddulph makes use of the metaphor of the “River of Masculinity”. The river here represents the handing on of wisdom from men to boys; the preparation that boys go through to join society as adults. It represents the rites of passage, initiations, apprenticing and skill-sharing that tribes, or villages would go through to prepare male youth for sustaining the community. It flows like a river, from generation to generation, over the millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biddulph makes the case that this river has been interrupted. Specifically, he cites the advent of industrialization as the main cause of this, while also noting the impact of global conflicts such as WWII. For me, this also links to industrialization’s parallel processes of urbanization and globalization, a notion that I touched on in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twicefire.com/summerschool&quot;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt;. This disruption has largely been self-inflicted for most industrialized societies. Biddulph does not dwell heavily on all the different ways the river has been diverted/dammed/blocked/disrupted; the core concept is that change/disruption has occurred and societies have not adapted sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dropping in two references early in the book, Biddulph does not explicitly reference this ‘river of masculinity’ again. It is not, for example, included in the index. I want to explore the metaphor a little deeper and link it to some other aspects of society and masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Down the river…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, the metaphor implies that there is stability and continuity when the river flows strongly. This should not be taken as a positive value judgment on the practices that are passed down via this flow. While the stability and continuity of these ‘rivers’ is largely missing from industrialized societies, the contents of those rivers no doubt included (or still includes) limiting ideas and concepts that we want to let go of. There is much to gain from understanding how societies functioned in the past and whether we are really addressing the developmental needs of our youth; however the solution is not to try to paddle up the river to a prior time. We must learn and integrate from the past, while forging a new future. I think Biddulph’s work would agree with this sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Disrupting the river as a means of subjugation&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reflection that came up for me is that the interruption of some rivers of masculinity has been a very deliberate act of disruption during colonialism, war, and conflict. European and other imperial and colonial ambitions have repeatedly disrupted the flow of the river in other societies, whether via literal killings, through to slavery, genocide, forced removal of children, banning of cultural practices, or encouraging drug dependency (often dove-tailed with increased criminalization, a la the USA “War on Drugs”). This attacking of the social fabric and its flow-on impacts are conveniently forgotten at times, when folks critique other societies as ‘backward’, ‘ungovernable’ and ‘failed’. This has come up strongly for me as I have just finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2KjeOdu&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Emu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a book that examines archaeological evidence and accounts of aboriginal societies from the writings and records of the earliest white colonists in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Reactionary confusion about the source of disruption&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think men in many societies are feeling the ebb of the river of masculinity. There are tangible senses of loneliness, disconnection, lack of belonging and meaning in many men. But only a vague sense of what is blocking the flow of the river, what the causes of it are. Of course, some men are adequately mentored and flourish. Some men manage to figure it out, and manage to self-initiate themselves in some fashion that gets them to a more holistic maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many men only get part of the way there. They get by in many ways but are also stuck in some areas. And others, lose their way. A self-destructive falling off the path can look like failed attempts to self-initiate (getting into all sorts of edgy situations), self-harm/self-sabotage, mental-health challenges (including suicide), or getting fixated/addicted to coping mechanisms. Losing one’s way can also be outward looking, or socially-destructive: joining gangs in search of mentorship, belonging and initiation; adopting victim-identities and blaming ‘others’, whether its their families, women, religious minorities, queer/trans folk, immigrants, foreigners, and the like, for the disconnection experienced; and/or taking all that a step further and joining far-right and/or nihilistic groups and contributing to harassment and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Losing the way&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ‘othered’ groups can be lazy targets for men who have lost their way. Women have done extensive work to create new post-industrial possibilities for women and to otherwise reclaim their power. This is a disruption to the classic skinny social contract that men and women got out of industrialization; a gross simplification of such being “men to the public sphere and women to the home”. If one gets fixated on thinking that women’s liberation is in competition to men’s liberation, counterproductive and reactionary behaviors can soon follow. Similar patterns can apply to the existence, survival, liberation and self-actualization efforts of the other groups and identities I touched on above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men who start falling down these paths become prime candidates for recruitment by fundamentalist militants, racial supremacists, far-right groups and other nihilistic efforts. They are the boy soldiers taught to rape as a weapon of war in the Congo; they are the Western-born men that are drawn to different flavors of stochastic terrorism. They are the foot-soldiers of ISIS; they are the white supremacists meeting in Charlottesville; they are the ‘edge-lords’ and shit-posters from 8Chan, egging on the ‘lone wolf’ mass shooters.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the metaphor, these ‘lost boys’ have typically been cut off from main-stream rivers of masculinity. But it is important to acknowledge that there are, I would argue small, ‘rivers of masculinity’ that are flowing strongly, mentoring their youth into socially destructive, dogmatic world-views, such as the various forms of ethno-fascism around the world. The strength of their convictions is attractive to those who have lost their way. Reconnecting and reinventing main-stream rivers of masculinity is a critical project in neutralizing the impact of these misguided lineages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reestablishing these rivers of masculinity is not just the work of helping men self-actualize; it is the work necessary to stop those men who are at risk of totally losing their way and harming others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initiation, mentorship, other men and rites of passage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the metaphor of the river, I want to connect &lt;em&gt;The New Manhood&lt;/em&gt; to the rites-of-passage focus of Stepping Stones. Biddulph focuses on a variety of key male relationships that shape the maturation process of men. The relationship to our fathers and immediate family is a critical one, detailed in the earliest chapters. The father-son relationship is made more critical by the preference for nuclear-family style living in industrialized nations (something worth reconsidering with how we raise youth). There is an important transition however, as youth enter their teenage years, when they need adult figures beyond their parents, to be mentors, guides and stewards. This is the main area of overlap between the &lt;em&gt;The New Manhood&lt;/em&gt; and Stepping Stones work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a specific buzzword, Biddulph does not use rites-of-passage (although he does reference a poem, &lt;em&gt;Rites of Manhood&lt;/em&gt; in his chapter about relating to women). However, the chapter “From Boy to Man” lays out a series of efforts that align with the form and content of rites-of-passage work with youth. Biddulph details three different organizations and efforts (including one called “The Rite Journey”), from Australia and Holland, and their ways of dealing with male youth in this transition phase. The two Australian accounts are school-based and involve significant intervention into one school year of the boys that go through the program. In contrast, Stepping Stones is separate from school, arcs over a longer period of time but has vastly less contact time between mentors and the youth. There are key overlapping aspects however: the inclusion of rites or  ceremonial aspects for marking the transition from child to adult life; the involvement of the family unit in this marking; the importance of building a bond between the youth and mentors; the importance of self-reflection; and the forging of a strong container and camaraderie between the boys involved in the programs. Certainly it is exciting and enlivening for me to read about other folks working with this critical rite of passage, and I am planning to research the different programs in greater depth at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biddulph does not speak to directly to this developmental phase himself, largely leaving it to the examples to illustrate the importance of this time period in a boy/man’s life. Alternatively, since his other best-seller, &lt;em&gt;Raising Boys&lt;/em&gt;, (I assume) heavily encompasses this period of development, he may just be keeping his powder dry for that book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Time of Ashes&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other important initiation that Biddulph covers is “The Time of Ashes”. When life goes wrong, and things turn sour, our character is truly tested and we must find our way again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are taught that adolescence is the big transition of life, as if there are no over important journey”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This moments are triggered by the inevitable challenges that life throws at us: an unexpected death in the family, the lost of a job, the end of a core-mastery, the partner that falls out of love with you, a miscarriage, a car crash, the lost of our parents… I wanted to mention this chapter (“The Journey Down”), to both honor the grief, pain and growth that comes from set-backs, if we take the time to process them, and to remind myself of the importance of all rites of passage, not just the one I am facilitating with these sets of boys. I think Stepping Stones does a great job of reminding everyone in the community that we are all constantly being initiated into new roles, and new phases of life; whether as group-leaders, elders of groups, parents or staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;In summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Manhood&lt;/em&gt; covers a wide range of the key aspects of ‘becoming a man’, in a fashion that can connect the ‘river of masculinity’ with the possibilities of emerging forms of positive masculinity. Biddulph closes the book with one last piece of advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a signpost. Don’t climb it, &lt;em&gt;go where it points&lt;/em&gt;. There is a larger life waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important reminder: we need to do; explore, attempt, learn, fail and repeat. In this learning, we should anticipate the emergence of multitudes of positive masculinities; there will not be a singular ‘woke’/positive masculinity that dominates and consumes all. I do not recommend Biddulph’s work to you as that singular new way to be explore masculinity but as a great enquiry into the subject, to deepen your own work. It has been a source of great reflection for me; Gratitude for the constant loving (and eccentric) presence of my father throughout my childhood, questions about my felt sense of a lack of mentorship outside a few exceptions, and further questions about the challenge of building new friendships with men. I sincerely hope you get a chance to enjoy a read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very excited about this news! I found out in early February that the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) was offering the course in July 2019 and was immediately fascinated. The course takes two of SFI’s core theme; interdisciplinary studies and complex systems studies and applies those to the relationship between cities and sustainability. I applied soon after finding out about the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I have been accepted, and am now gleefully checking the student list as folks fill out their little bios. I am very curious to see what sorts of people are going to make up our cohort and what their respective paths and journeys have been to this point. Already we have representation from India, Mexico, Jordan, Nepal, China, the USA, and other regions, with a mix of academic, public sector, and private sector folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is the course about?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2007 was the turning point at which &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/the-worlds-urban-population-is-growing-so-how-can-cities-plan-for-migrants-49931&quot;&gt;more than half of humanity&lt;/a&gt; lived in urban settings; in cities. This urbanization has been building over the last few centuries, and is interwoven with other significant trends, such as industrialization and globalization. Cities can be thought of as complex systems, with many variables, inputs, outputs, feedback loops. This frame can be applied both to their place in a globalized society and economy, and also their internal workings with cross city movement, support systems (sewage, power, communications, etc), social life and a city’s relationship to its physical surrounds. The course certainly seeks to look at cities as complex systems and to unpick numerous aspects of their make up from a sustainability point of view. As it stands, the archetypal way of being for cities is that they are heavy coalescing points for resources and specialization, that are dependent on sucking in vast resources and people from elsewhere. This has typically occurred in an unsustainable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Why the sustainability focus for cities?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interwoven trends of urbanization, globalization and industrialization have rapidly shifted humanity’s relationship to the environment, namely through increased consumption of resources and increased strain on ecological systems as a result of human activities. The 21st century is seeing a shift in the global climate at a speed which the earth has not seen. The speed of this shift is generating climate-based chaos in ecological systems across the globe. These systems have buffers and feedback loops to maintain some level of homeostasis or stability within systems but the change is so rapid that many of these stabilizers are exhausted or at risk of failing. These failures can take years and decades to play out, longer than the typical attention span of citizens and decision-makers today but barely a blink of the age from a ecological change perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity’s current mode of being is unsustainable. Something must change, and it will change, whether we are in control of that change or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, the proportion of humanity living in urban settings has only increased. If we are going to reach a point where humanity can &lt;em&gt;sustain&lt;/em&gt; our population levels, we have to find ways to make cities more sustainable, since that is where the bulk of humanity has concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are yearnings in some circles for a full ‘return to the land’; a move away from urban settings and back to more rural ways of being. While the cultivation of our relationship to nature is often a missing part of urban life (and worthy of being addressed!), the rejection of city-life as a whole mode of being is very likely an unattainable goal for most. There is a curious (and small) intersection of peoples who are ‘privileged’ enough to be able to make this transition back ‘to the land’ (or are already there in a fashion) and reject urban life altogether. However, it is difficult for most. Cities and urban life, as the predominant way of being for humanity, need to be centered in our efforts to prevent and mitigate climate chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is drawing me to the course&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love cities. I love the energy of them, the opportunities, the richness, the diversity that is possible. I want their depth and positive aspects to continue. But they can be soul-destroying, denaturing and unsustainable. I want to see how we can save them and this course offers some interesting opportunities to explore that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to spark a shift within my company, HERE technologies, in providing geo data and services that help answer questions about sustainability and cities. The institutional inertia I am up against is sizable but I will have a crack at it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pull is to meet, be inspired by and support all the other people draw to this course. To strengthen my own path towards addressing climate chaos and to help others on their own paths in regards to that. Obviously I will take a geospatial angle on the various problem sets we encounter. But I also hope to share my experiences with rites of passage, nature and other more social and societal aspects of this challenge space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also very plainly excited to return to New Mexico. The area around Taos and Santa Fe is a special one. And I hear Meow Wolf has a new story-line!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I consider myself part of the privileged group that might be able to have a go at getting away from the globalized interdependency of city-life. I have sufficient resources, skills and inclination to make a decent crack at it if I so chose to do so at some point in the future. Regardless of whether I do or not, the importance of how effective we are at making cities sustainable will have huge implications for my own life, that of my children and of the fate of humanity and much of the earth’s current bio-diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I enter into the final year with my first Stepping Stones youth group, I have decided to take on another. This is my commitment to the importance I place on mentoring and modelling positive masculinities to boys as they are coming of age. But how does rites of passage relate to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core beliefs of the Stepping Stones Project is that many industrialized societies/communities have let go of or forgotten collective rites of passage for youth, for the time period when they transition from childhood to adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inherent in this belief is the forgotten importance of rites of passage; a collective way for us to mark and acknowledge the maturation process of youth, as they transition into later stages of development. This marking of maturation, and the role-modeling and mentoring that are bound up with it, can provide a crucial role in helping folk ‘find their place’, in their families, communities, or universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping Stones use the concept of the ‘broken village’ to encapsulate the narrative of the letting go of youth rites of passage. For most of human civilization, the prototypical ‘way of life’ has largely revolved around the social group the size of a village. In our modern context, that sizing of social group is largely ‘broken’ over time and space. Our social time and attention tends to be split over a larger quantity of people, a larger area and without as much consistency over time. The innovation of ‘cities’ has resulted in many positive and negative disruptions in how humans have experienced their ‘way of life’, and the role of ‘city-life’ is related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the qualities of the ‘broken village’ model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We live in greater density of people and structures,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This density means we know and rely on our immediate neighbors vastly less,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The density tends to be co-located with the exclusion of nature; leading to a disassociation from nature and also our own bodies,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is less and less inter-generational co-location; we tend to be geographical separated from our blood families,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These factors have come together to interrupt the prototypical developmental flow that existed in past ‘village’ life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some flow on implications from this simple model include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feelings of trust, safety and belonging are harder to maintain/generate in larger groups;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The increased alienation from nature and our bodies tends towards a spiritual or metaphysical alienation; feelings of ‘rootlessness’, isolation and loneliness seep in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While cities create diverse opportunities for communities to emerge around more fringe pursuits, creating new ways of belonging and connection, they have tended to not fully address all our social needs.

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;This all might read as me being a big downer on cities. I am not, I love them and think they have lots of interesting trade-offs. Just not wanting to tangent into all that&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stepping Stones Project sees rites of passage as a crucial vehicle by which to address these interwoven challenges, and our specific program as one effort in returning rites of passage to modern life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization focuses on the rite of passage that marks the transition from childhood to adolescence. But there is a network effect to how the organization integrates the leaders, youth, families-of-youth and elders into this process. Groups include two co-leaders and an elder, striving to close the inter-generational gap. Initiation is the recurring theme with rites of passage; as we initiate the youth into young adulthood, the leaders and elders are being initiated into new roles and responsibilities, as mentors and wisdom-sharers. The life of the group also seeks to involve parents in their own initiation; coming into being a parent for a young adult. An experience that is decidedly different than being the parent of a ‘kid’. These initiations, if marked and witnessed, can also be seen as rites of passage for new or different phases of our adult lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is ultimately in service of maturation, across generations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking and noting these transitions and maturations is vital to an individual’s integration of them. The more we can return that to our lives, the more we will be able to collectively and individually navigate the challenges ahead of us. To loop us back to the initial spark of this piece, I’m looking forward to introducing another collection of families to this rite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to pinpoint when we lost Gerald. He had been a member of our three year ‘rite of passage’ youth group from the very beginning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steppingstonesproject.org/&quot;&gt;(run through the Stepping Stones Project)&lt;/a&gt;. In someway, all the boys were ‘lost’ when they joined the group; we all are in some fashion at that age. Transitioning from the relatively simple perspective of a child, to life as a young adult, is a wild ride for most folks. Finding most of the boys took time. We  faced disruption over much of the groups existence: the wild energy of the group, boys leaving the group as a consequence of that (both disruptor and disruptees); more boys joining the group; my first co-leader leaving the group, and the transition to Chaise, my current co-leader. Gerald brought a subtle mischievous angle into the group over this time; deflections away from deeper questioning, rambolic stories in response to council prompts, ‘bonding’ that involved trolling/heckling group members past their limits. However he was not so dissimilar from the other boys that have found their peace within the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major purpose of the group is to hold the youths’ experiences, whatever that may be. This includes their nascent social patterns, with the hope we can allow them to be comfortable enough to reflect on those patterns in a group context. If one of the youth has some social anxiety or a relating challenge, and have formed disruptive strategies for dealing with that, the length of the group (several years) is meant to allow for this dynamic to be worked through, instead of just shutting it down and smothering it. We have made that transition with the rest of the boys in the group (not to suggest that they’ve come to terms with their challenges!). And due to a mix of circumstances, it did not work out for Gerald in the time we had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the group was collectively dropping in deeper together over the last year, Gerald was not budging. It was difficult to see at first, but in the last half of 2018, it became more obvious. I noticed some anxiety come up for me, when thinking about Gerald’s pace of integration. We had our ‘summer trip’ booked for early October 2018 (on my birthday and anniversary weekend; another story, don’t let me start…). I knew that trip would be so critical for all the boys, getting them to land more fully into the group. Gerald had missed one of the two trips from our first year, something that he had jokingly turned into a bit of a complex, ‘forbidding’ discussion or references to group adventures he had missed out on. For all the boys and for Gerald in particular, I was waiting for that October trip to bond us together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, Gerald had started at a new high school, of his choice. This turned out to be a decisive factor. It is a very academically focused school. Very rapidly, the pressure Gerald was placing on himself to crush academically was apparent. We started getting calls and messages from his parents that he was stressing about coming to the group; he wanted to finish his homework. We learnt that it was not uncommon for him to stay up past midnight, finishing his homework and then waking up at 6:30 am to get to school on time the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing that, I was totally aghast; How could 30+ hours of homework per week be sustainable or reasonable for any teenager?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rushed to look up what reasonable levels of homework were: there is a mix of views on the validity of homework but no one was recommending anything near that level of time spent. I made my fear and concern about Gerald’s situation known to his parents. They shared my concerns and added some more detail: a large proportion of that homework was optional. It was Gerald’s fear of ‘falling behind’ that was diving him to grind away at every piece. Gerald homework trap was largely self-inflicted. :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a double whammy for Gerald’s participation in the group; he would miss meetings because he was sick from the stress he was under, or just not show up if he felt too far behind on homework. And when he did show up, he was exhausted, irritated and otherwise under-resourced to deal with his social anxiety. And to top it off, he ended up getting very sick just before the summer trip, something he was already very stressed about due to the time-off he would have to take from assignments and homework. He did not make it on the trip, yet another great bonding experience for the group that Gerald had missed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerald’s journey over this time had been in stark contrast to that of the other boys in the group. With the richness of our trip to Bodega, with the fire vigil, wind-swept hill, and kayak adventure, and the continued dipping into council, the rest of the group have relaxed into a more open way of sharing with one another. The new phase for the group, of being able to slow down and take life in has been such a blessing. This, regrettably, was not how things were for Gerald. Sharing vulnerably was unbearable for him, as he continued to be trapped in his social anxiety. His coping mechanisms for these times were… disruptive, to say the least. We tried to give applicable feedback to the group and Gerald specifically, about the limits we had for disruption, over those six months. Unfortunately, it just was not landing for Gerald. As 2018 wound down, the question of what to do with Gerald only got louder, especially when our ropes course day long, another key opportunity to bond with the group, was cancelled because of the wildfire smoke blanketing the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question hung over the group during the holiday break and was right on the agenda in the first fire circle of 2019, with the wider Stepping Stones community (leaders, elders and staff). The tension I was holding about Gerald’s situation was very present at this meeting. As we went around the circle for everyone’s initial check-in and role for the evening, I posed my role for the evening as the ‘questioner’, pondering what to do about Gerald. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the talking piece was passed to Chaise for his check-in, he described his role as the ‘humane executioner’. I immediately knew what he meant; removing Gerald from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chaise named that ‘role’, the reality of my deep resistance to that idea was finally uncovered. As the fire circle meeting continued, along with additional little moments of dialogue and reflection about this, this reality, of the need to remove Gerald, was fully dawning on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of fire circles is peer-counsel: asking for advice and wisdom from the wider Stepping Stones community. I felt time running down, without us dropping into counsel. A key community member, someone I really wanted to hear our challenge and provide wisdom, left early. My anxiety about whether we were even going to have time to fit in counsel was building: I had to speak up as we transitioned from one activity to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I surfaced by concern about time and not getting to counsel, and shared that I was holding a lot of tension around what we needed to share with the circle. The circle facilitators assured me that we were going to go into counsel as the last thing before we broke for the evening. After a dyad/paired exercise, it was time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember it being our time to share about Gerald, and as I was about to speak, feeling the full force of the realization that yes, factoring in the whole context, it really felt like the only way forward was to remove Gerald from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many emotions bubbled up and ultimately out of me in that moment. I had fought so hard to keep this group together, to make it work. I really got to know and love each of these boys; each one of them is so dearly missed by the whole group when they could not attend. Acknowledging in my heart that Gerald had to go generated great sadness in me for him, and I, at some level, felt like I was failing him by not being able to guide him to marking with the whole group. I cannot recall how much of this I covered or mentioned; I was choking up with emotion. I wanted to be present to those emotions and feel them, but also still be able to articulate myself about our problem. I acknowledged my resistance to taking Gerald out of the group and how Chaise’s comment at the start of the fire circle had pulled the veil from my eyes. I knew, with precious little time left for the group before marking, that even if a decent solution could be attempted, that we would have to reorient the entire group experience around Gerald. It felt like we had to choose between Gerald’s experience of the group and everyone elses (including our own).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt good to be held and counselled by that circle. Inter-generational care and wisdom were shared. Chaise got to speak his piece, less choked up than myself, and we got to consider next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually met with the boys two days later. Boy oh boy, did Gerald strongly reinforce the need for him to transition out of the group. We played hot-seat, where each group member would sit in the ‘hot seat’ and each of us got to ask them one question, which they had to answer truthfully or pass (if the question was too much). Gerald stalled, he cross-talked, he interjected, slowing things up. He froze when it was his chance to ask questions, he even tried to poll everyone ELSE about what question he should ask. Gerald happened to be leaving early that night, so he was hoping against hope that his departure time would arrive before he had to sit in the hot seat. Once he was the last one who had not gone up to the hot seat, he claimed that he had been the second one to go up there and thus did not need to go up there. Finally, he got up in the hot seat and we struggled through the questions asked of him… The energy of the group was shot and Gerald’s picking up of the floor mats and slinging them around became the game of the moment. As we shut that down, Gerald’s departure time came and the group collectively dropped from a frantic high to a more laid-back vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up talking to Gerald on the phone the night after, thinking that his behavior was clearly a sign that things were rough with homework and that he resented even being in the group. On the call we asked him about his experience of the group; He was happy with it, and keen to continue being in the group. He seemed to have no idea that his behavior was disruptive (and his parents reiterated later that this was his sincere understanding of his behavior). Putting the phone down, I realized; we were not helping someone escape from a situation they did not want to be in. We were going to be pushing them out of a group they wanted to be a part of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arranged to meet with Gerald’s parents. Our group elder, Pat, hosted us all on a Sunday afternoon. I knew we had to get to the point of the meeting as soon as feasible. Right out, I outlined that Chaise, Pat and myself were in agreement that Gerald had to go. Gerald’s parents were heart-broken. They both were keenly aware of the challenges Gerald faced socially with his anxiety and also the pressure he was putting himself under with school. They reiterated that one of the things that drew them to Stepping Stones was the structured social space in which kids like Gerald might be able to work through the challenge of relating and attuning to others. They expressed appreciation for the care and love we showed Gerald and also some frustration that perhaps with earlier intervention, Gerald’s departure from the group would not have been inevitable. Unfortunately, we only have so much time and resources to tend to the life of the group; maybe 160 hours over the year for both co-leaders. Stepping Stones is not pitched as a space for youth who need lots of individual focus and support. This is part of the harshness we were all experiencing; we all could see how much Gerald needed support. And all recognised how the group ultimately could not contain Gerald’s challenging presence. We outlined a plan to have Gerald attend the group one last time, in a transition ceremony to mark his time with the group. A chance to give him and the boys some measure of closure about this change in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some negotiation, preparation and time, the day arrived. The group met at our regular time but without Gerald, his parents and Pat. We had let the other boy’s parents know that Gerald was leaving the group and if any boys wanted to write something for Gerald, now was the time. We got feedback from some parents that their son was not surprised something like this was happening. While we were meeting with the rest of the group, Gerald, his parents and Pat were meeting at Pat’s place for a short renegotiation council, reflecting on their relationships as parent and child. Specifically, it was to ask about things the parents and child want to leave behind and what new things to cultivate as the child emerges into young adulthood. Meanwhile the group prepared a council space and we awaited their arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so glad that Gerald showed up. I can imagine how intense it would have been for me to have to show up to a group that I was forced to leave, as my 14 or 15 year old self. Let alone how it must have been for Gerald, with his history of social anxiety. We started with naming our intention; to honor Gerald’s time with the group and wish him well on his way. We started with an the prompt, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is a meaningful moment you shared with Gerald during your time in the group? Or what is one hope you have for Gerald’s future?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This was everyone’s chance to say something about Gerald and it was a mix of short sweet well-wishes and deeper reflections on times and laughs shared. After this we returned the talking piece to the council center and offered an open witnessing prompt. We asked for anyone that felt called to take the talking piece from the circle center and share something about Gerald that they had witnessed about him over the two years he had been a part of the group. After a pause, one of the boys started us with a really sweet reflection on how nice and easy going Gerald was to be around. I reflected on a special circumstance that Gerald shared with another boy in the group, how that it was so sweet that they had got to be in the group together and that I hoped that they would get to continue their friendship. The other boy took the talking piece immediately after and also shared how special it had been to share the group with Gerald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerald’s parents also got to share their experiences of the group as parents, and how grateful they were to the boys for sharing their heart-thoughts and feelings about Gerald. At different parts of the process, we tried to allow space for Gerald to speak to the group. He refused, even after one of his parents tried to counsel him about how they had previously practiced what he wanted to say to each of us. It was hard to see Gerald disassociating so hard at this point. It was too much for him to share. I hope that what was shared by his folks and the rest of the group really landed for him, if not on then but at some later point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finished with a little gifting session, where Chaise and I both had gifts to send Gerald on his way. We closed the council and we had a few stilted minutes of getting out of the solemn energy of the council. Individually we said goodbye to Gerald and he and his parents departed. We had thirty minutes and the group really wanted to jump into hot-seat for those of us that were not at the prior hot-seat meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have so much happening in such a short time with the group. Ropes course, summer trip, renegotiation ceremony, more meetings, marking ceremony… I am excited for the deep potential of this time ahead for the group. The question of what do with Gerald has been answered, even if it still gives me a moment’s pause when I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping Stones folks are oft to note that so much of the swell and sway of our lives are forms of initiation. This was another initiation for me as a group leader and a mentor, around a lesson that was a hard one to learn; how and when do we arrive at the point where we need to remove someone from our field, our group, possibly even our lives, when they are someone that you love and care for deeply.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A generic mental model for geo-data acquisition]]></title><description><![CDATA[I am going to dive into outlining a generic mental model for what organizations tend to do when they have geo-data acquisition needs.

A model like this is useful for creating a common understanding for how organizations tend to deal with the challenges around acquiring geo-data.
&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: very specific reflections on a niche domain I have spent a lot of time operating in. Planning on adding more about metrics at a later date&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;General model for geo-data acquisition&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When seeking to describe a model for anything, a tension exists between simplifying the model down to the most essential aspects, and including nothing more. It is obviously important to detail what is in a model; less obviously, it is also critical to detail what is not included in a model or otherwise delegated to higher or lower scopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my observations of geo-data acquisition practices in the Anglo-American (“Five Eye”) intelligence community, in Terravion, an aerial imagery start up, and working for the Capture Systems team in HERE, the most essential elements for the general model for geo-data acquisition are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquisition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Requirements define what data/outcomes are needed.&lt;/em&gt; The bulk of work around requirements stems from understanding the business problem that needs to be solved, expressing that as a singular requirement or a set of requirements, and framing those requirements in a way that can be easily passed to the acquisition part of the cycle. Typically this process also includes prioritization, basic cost analysis and a way to keep requestors up to date with the ongoing status of their requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Acquisition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two broadest categories of acquisition are 1) &lt;em&gt;getting the data from someone else&lt;/em&gt; 2) &lt;em&gt;collecting it yourself.&lt;/em&gt; While there are operational differences between requesting and receiving data from an external source, versus operating one’s own collection platforms, they share a common lifecycle: requirements need to be translated into acquisition planning, and data needs to be furnished in an agreed-on format and schema. The data provider in either case ought to go through processes including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking whether they already have data to satisfy a requirement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If collection is required, breaking down requirements into a plan of specific tasks for their collection platform to execute on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collection operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collection validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If data is externally sourced, these processes tend to be shielded from other actors in the rest of the cycle. If internally sourced, the implementation details of collection platform operation can leak out all through the overall cycle, if care is not taken to effectively encapsulate the collection platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feedback is the process of matching the acquired data up to its originating requirements, and confirming whether the acquired data fulfills those requirements.&lt;/em&gt;  Often, the acquired data will undergo further processing and analysis after it has been received. Consequently, feedback may either be incremental or held up until all processing has been completed. The health or efficiency of the overall lifecycle is dependent on whether the feedback flowing back to the rest of the cycle is timely, concise and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is left out of this model?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps prior to defining requirements are left out. Figuring out what problem sets or market fit are important for an organization; this process is where requirements come from. However delving into that would be a distraction from the core cycle of the model. Similarly, steps after feedback beyond scope; how processing is done, how the data is served or archived, marketing to customers, etc. All important aspects to consider for an organization as a whole but distracting for our current focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers who are familiar with data acquisition might be wondering about some key aspect of the acquisition cycle they are familiar with, and questioning why it is not included. What about ingestion or routing? Or task orchestration? Where is the campaign management? Data integrity/security/privacy? Or quality assurance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tend to be implementation details of the wider cycle. Depending on the scale of data acquisition in an organization, it makes sense to call out more specific steps and sub-processes as they are required. In the same way that routing, fleet management and other collection operations are sub-components of the overall theme of acquisition, quality assurance, ingestion, data integrity measures, etc, are ultimately all forms of feedback. It is not uncommon for different organizations or groups to use different names (campaign management, scope management, collection orchestration) for the same function (a process to ensure requirements are turned into instructions for acquisition platforms). This cross-labelling risk applies even to this model. I have tried to establish the most generic labels for separating the major conceptual parts of the cycle, with requirements, acquisition, and feedback. Perhaps more “intuitive” terms exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is the scale of the model?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model is meant to broadly define the major de facto stages of data acquisition, whether undertaken by a small startup, multi-agency governmental community, global multi-national company or even an individual. As an individual, I might be interested in buying a rural property. In order to inform myself about the property’s potential, I might determine I want to assess the soil composition of the area and seasonal sun exposure on the property (hopefully information I can get from the local council/government). Additionally, I might even bring my drone on a visit, and get an overhead view of the spatial relationships across the property. All of this can be expressed in the frame of a generic data acquisition model: figuring out my requirements, acquiring the data from other sources or via my drone, and checking the data (perhaps in real-time on the drone’s live-video feed) against my requirements (the feedback phase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense to apply a generic data acquisition model to my interest in a property? No. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the model might generally describe what steps I take in getting geo-data related to the property, it probably will not help me catch aspects I may have missed, or otherwise have failed to coordinate. The scale of my project is so small, it easily fits inside my head. Thus, while the model can be applied to smaller scales, it is most useful when applied to larger scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the scale of a data acquisition effort increases, so increases the value of a shared, clear operating picture, good instrumentation, and data driven decision making. These things are underpinned by a clear mental model for the data acquisition cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an organization grows, its data acquisition cycle graduates from a simple process shared between a few people, to a process that involves more and more components, people and specialized responsibilities. An acquisition cycle that was small, simple and easy to understand when an organization was just getting off the ground, will likely evolve during the growth of the organization in messy and unclear ways. This organizational confusion shows up in a variety of ways, which will be addressed in the next section on common pitfalls in data acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Common challenges in the data acquisition cycle&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a non-exhaustive list of common challenges organizations encounter when scaling their data acquisition efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Requirement-related challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Skipping requirements&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there is no requirement process or individuals in an organization just skip them, the risk is that resources will be misallocated when acquiring data. This risk only increases as the number of acquisition platforms and data requestors increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete existing data check&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When requirements come in, it is wise to check against existing data holdings. If a requirement is already serviced by existing data, it should be satisfied with that. Not addressing this challenge results in the organization using resources to require unnecessary data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete prioritization system&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If requirements are not prioritized, and/or there is not a clear system by which prioritization occurs, the overall cycle will either misallocate resources to lesser requirements or be delayed as manual efforts are required to seek priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete/confusing requirements interface&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are multiple ways to submit requirements, unclear processes or poorly defined responsibilities for handling requirements, confusion will rain. The data acquisition cycle will miss requirements, misallocate resources, and fail to consistently serve the goals of the wider organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Challenges in the space between requirements and acquisition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Requirements that do not translate to clear acquisition tasks&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be coherent ways to translate requirements into tasks for an acquisition platform. The differences in how acquisition platforms operate means that this requires careful thinking and design for any requirement coordinating system. Failure to achieve this means that acquisition platforms will be mis-tasked (thus wasting resources and missing opportunities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Lack of knowledge about acquisition platform particulars&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every data acquisition system will attempt to abstract the differences between acquisition platforms, and even the differences between individual instances of those platforms. If the requirements system does not allow the articulation of requirements that use the full capabilities of an acquisition platform, the organization will end up missing out on those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Acquisition-related challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete orchestration&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orchestration is the process whereby collections of requirements are compared to see which ones overlap or are complimentary, allowing for a more efficient set of tasks to be provided to an acquisition platform. Naïve orchestration will create tasks that are nearly identical, duplicating effort and wasting resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Collection anomalies&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every acquisition platform will have anomalies and edge-cases that will make its output less useful. Whether this is atmospheric conditions for clouds, road closures for road-based collectors or software glitches, these errors and blips are a given. Making sure these are tracked and mitigated is a common challenge in data acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback-related challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Skip feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipping a systemic approach to feedback works fine for small scale operations; verbal or ad-hoc feedback about data problems suffices. This does not work as an organization scales. Skipping feedback ultimately just pushes this work on to your customers/end-users, except by that stage there may be no effective way to trace problems back to their origin in the data acquisition cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Slow feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer requirements are left open or acquisition platforms are left without completion feedback, the longer they are left in an unclear state. This can impact orchestration (for example: do you include a requirement in orchestration today, when it was meant to be collected last week but you don’t know if that collection worked?), and otherwise lowers agility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting effective feedback on what acquisition tasks have been completed but not which requirements have been satisfied, or vice-versa, are examples of incomplete feedback. Failing to address this will undermine different decision points throughout the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Deidentified feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the data identities are not meaningfully tracked through the data acquisition cycle, feedback becomes a challenging forensic process. If someone comes to you and states “these pieces of data are corrupted” and there are not ways to easily identify which task they were acquired by, which requirements they relate to or which acquisition platform they stem from, debugging what is going wrong becomes a time-consuming feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incremental feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing acquired data can require several stages and take time. Some parts of the data might be finished before others. This can make it difficult to define when an acquisition task or a requirement is “done”. If this detail is not ironed out, it can result in confusing statistics on the progress of data acquisition, leading to chaotic decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wider challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Lack of shared understanding of an organization’s data acquisition cycle&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If individuals working within the data acquisition cycle do not share a common understanding of the cycle, trouble-shooting issues and improving the cycle becomes chaotic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete privacy controls&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquired data can easily include ways to identify individuals and risk breaching their privacy. For both moral and legal reasons, having a system wide awareness of privacy matters is the only way to mitigate the risk of privacy breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete security controls&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, system wide security awareness ought to be calibrated to the level of risk. Sufficiently large scale technology companies should consider their networks compromised and secure internally on that assumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Misalignment between requirement, acquisition and feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge tends to show up when data acquisition cycles undergo great change in their requirements or access to acquisition platforms. Understanding of new demands or new/lost acquisition platforms has not spread sufficiently across people and systems involved in the whole cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Process duplication&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process duplication is when there are multiple parts an organization repeating the same functionality in the data acquisition cycle, or the organization has completely separate data acquisition cycles co-existing. Acquisition platforms will proliferate, if they have justifiably different capabilities and use-cases. It’s harder to justify having multiple requirement-management or feedback systems; proliferating these tends to cause chaos, as requestors have to petition multiple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Complex coupling&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When different parts of the acquisition cycle are coupling in complex ways, making changes to the different sub-sections or adding new sub-sections to the overall cycle becomes awkward. Changes in one system can cause problems downstream. A common time this becomes apparent is when the acquisition cycle revolves around a particular platform, and then a new platform is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Unclear reference geometry&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geo-data is unsurprising heavily dependent to having geometric representations. One frustrating challenge that can plague a data acquisition cycle is having reference geometries that do not suit all parts of the cycle, or having unclear ways of translating between the different reference geometry in different parts of the cycle. To provide a task to an acquisition platform, you typically need very well defined geometric instructions: collect all data on these specific roads, or point the sensor at this point on the earth when the platform is at this geometry in space. It is important that these discrete geometries match the intent of geometries defined in requirements, which tend to be coarser. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Priors: Mental Models]]></title><description><![CDATA[I use “Mental models” as a shorthand term for the idea that the way a single human mind comprehends reality, is not reality.

&lt;p&gt;The saying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation&quot;&gt;“The map is not the territory”&lt;/a&gt; is the most common expression of this idea. Why is it important to note this distinction? If we forget the distinction, we end up thinking that our perception of reality &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; actually reality. The negative consequence of letting that replacement happen is we lose touch with reality, and as conditions and circumstances change, we fail to adjust our thinking and actions to our context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why can’t we know the totality of a thing or reality itself?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the totality of a thing, or reality itself requires omniscience: total knowledge and understanding over time. Human cognition currently seems ill-equipped for such a task. &lt;em&gt;;) sly wink&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Limited sensory ability&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, our senses provide us with an assortment of limited inputs. Our cognitive processes transform these disparate streams into an astoundingly impressive illusion. Take our vision for example. A simple mental model of our vision imagines it to be like a camera, scanning the outside world and capturing everything it sees, pixel for pixel. The reality is that we can only actively see a tiny part of our field of vision at any time, and our brains are otherwise generating a cohesive view of the world &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception&quot;&gt;(see this entry on Visual Perception for more detail)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are essentially perceiving only a tiny part of everything around us. Meanwhile, our brain is predicting everything else in our sensory field, trying to make a coherent scene out of it all. At this extreme, our brain is creating a mental model of the reality that is all around us. It is built up on thousands of hours of observation and experimentation as infants: dropping our spoons from our high chairs; standing; falling; making noises that echo off walls; grasping any object placed in our tiny hands. We inherit a bunch of our initial stimuli responses from our genetics but largely we learn them as we transition from being a tiny zygote in the womb, into a proto-consciousness and beyond. We tend to take it for granted, that each of us has developed this rich and detailed model of reality. It is truly a marvel if one looks closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Does ‘objective’ reality exist?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Objective’ reality is mediated by our mental model of it. Strictly speaking, that is not very objective at all. Does objective reality exist then? I posit that, functionally, yes it does exist. Without diving off the metaphysical or spiritual deep-ends, we come into this existence as a sensing/thinking/feeling entity, tumbling around in a chaotic mess of sensory inputs, and we consistently unpickle that mess into understandings about the physical world, language, human interactions, abstract concepts and much more. Of course, once we start layering in language, social interactions and abstract concepts, we start proliferating all sorts of mental models to make sense of the inter-subjective part of our existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While language can help us share abstract mental models, like the concept of a divine spirit, a nation-state, or a company, that homo sapien super-power is not sufficient to overcome the perceptual barrier between our cognition and objective reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;What are the practical outcomes of thinking in ‘mental models’?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging that even strongly held concepts about the world are only partial representations; inaccurate in some way we can’t see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging that any model of the world is going to be some sort of simplification of what is going on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discernment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While these factors mean that we accept that all models are wrong, we can also determine that some models are more ‘useful’ than others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We see two means of understanding the usefulness of a model: Korzybski links usefulness to the model having a ‘similar structure’ to reality, thus allowing us to make predictions and acts upon it. Harari stated a related case for thinking of usefulness as power; how much power could be derived from a model of reality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to consciously switch into thinking about a situation with a different mental model; that of the person standing in front of you, of a different political belief, of different school of thought. (Of course, we must acknowledge that there are mental models we hold that we cannot shake and that we might not know which or what they are.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting a more holistic view of a situation by looking at it with several mental models.&lt;/li&gt;

Or what you, as a novice of any mastery, could learn from that? If your ‘lack of talent’ is holding you back from taking up singing, carpentry or computer programming? Whether talent even exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“…Secrets from the new science of expertise”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: I have spent some time looking at expertise, starting with physical skill acquisition. Read this book thoroughly but have not yet looked into all my research leads around expertise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an interest in getting better at your pursuits, skills and masteries, read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Peak, Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool have set out to both study and concisely present research into the question of how do humans ‘get better at stuff’. Peak seeks to breakdown the research being conducted in the field, add in some little stories to flesh the ideas and concepts out and also wades into some of the implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key concepts the book discusses are &lt;strong&gt;deliberate practice, mental representation, mentorship, and feedback.&lt;/strong&gt; I found the book very engaging, due to my interest in this domain and that it was quite disgestable to me; linking to my strong priors, such as &lt;em&gt;mental models, tight feedback loops, mentorship&lt;/em&gt; from a rites of passage frame and prior reading about &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt;. In essence, we build mastery most effectively by undertaking focused, limits-of-ability practice, either under direct coaching (mentorship) or after developing powerful &lt;em&gt;mental representations&lt;/em&gt; that allow for masterful &lt;em&gt;feedback&lt;/em&gt;. There are specific conditions attached to these general terms: you can’t just do one aspect of deliberate practice and expect to progress. So I will unpack some of those aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Deliberate practice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should I care about deliberate practice? Two major drives for acquiring a skill include wanting to survive and, for the sheer joy of its mastery. If you really want to excel at surviving (hey, some of us are quite keen on living) or simply love getting better at the hobbies and disciplines we practice, deliberate practice is something we should be engaging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I need to work at getting better at stuff, right, of course… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What one needs to take from the idea of deliberate practice is that just putting in hours of practice is not enough; there are specific conditions that need to happen for it to be fully effective. For illustrative purposes, I’ll list some of the things that lead us to ‘degraded practice’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go through the motions; we stop paying attention to our practice; we don’t get expert mentorship; we do not analyse our practice to get self-feedback; and … we bail on practice altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we place the two on a spectrum, what does it take to push us from the ‘degraded practice’ end of a spectrum, to the deliberate practice end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a clearly defined and well established path to mastery, with easily identifiable experts; I am labelling these &lt;a href=&quot;#cef&quot;&gt;“Clear expertise fields”&lt;/a&gt;, something not common to all fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#mentor&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/a&gt; from teachers/masters of the discipline; adjusting if a teacher can no longer push you beyond your limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meaningful, regular &lt;a href=&quot;#feed&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#menrep&quot;&gt;Mental representations&lt;/a&gt;, that allow one to self-correct errors during practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued &lt;a href=&quot;#foc&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; during practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ooc&quot;&gt;Practice that is ‘difficult’&lt;/a&gt;; it continues to push your boundaries, even if this is exhausting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;“Clear expertise” fields &lt;a name=&quot;cef&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fields tend to have two main qualities. 1) The field is already well-developed, so expectations about mastery and paths to achieving that are already well-defined. and 2) the field has direct competition and rankings that make it ‘easy’ to compare practitioners. Examples of this span chess, classical music, all sorts of sports but particularly individual sports, martial arts, and structured forms of dance. As the authors say on p.98, “What doesn’t qualify?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much anything in which there is no or little direct competition, such as gardening … [being a] business manager, teacher, electrician, engineer, consultant, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is somewhat unfortunate if you care muchly about one of those “excluded” fields, something I will explore later with software engineering. I would also argue to include aviation, medicine, civil engineering and similar as ‘clear expertise’ fields; fields that do not have competition perse but that have well defined metrics (often with life or death consequences!) by which to gauge interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Mentorship &lt;a name=&quot;mentor&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentors guide you on your path to mastery. They often set one’s curriculum, shift the focus of practice and, most importantly, they provide rapid, accurate feedback on errors. Getting accurate and speedy feedback is one of the most powerful mechanisms in human experience. It is the essential underpinning of how we learn to navigate reality overtime. Mentors greatly improve this feedback process, particularly if the discipline is well understood. Beyond their instructive guidance, a broader sense of being mentored by someone no doubt has benefits to motivation and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Feedback &lt;a name=&quot;feed&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are constantly predicting what will happen around us and correcting our expectations based on sensory input. The feedback we glean from practice and from our mentors is just a more built-up version of this. While mentor feedback is very valuable, to pursue excellence, one must figure out how to give oneself worthwhile feedback. This leads us to …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Mental representations &lt;a name=&quot;menrep&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson and Pool place great importance on their concept of &lt;em&gt;mental representations&lt;/em&gt;. They are important because they must be developed by practitioners for them to be able to critique themselves. Think of how a musician can glance at a score and immediate develop a ‘sense’ of how it should sound. A dancer feeling the stickiness of their last sequence and knowing that they did not quite nail it. A chess master or a professional soccer player can look at a snapshot of their respective fields of play and predict what will happen next. Mental representations also define how we structure our skills and their interrelated parts in our minds. Like how a guitarist will structure collections of notes into chords and progressions. I would add that “clear expertise” fields probably have defined mental representations formally, and have them shared across the whole discipline. Where as in other less mature/structured fields, there are a multitude of bespoke mental representations going around and it becomes unclear how easily concepts can be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Focus &lt;a name=&quot;foc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to stick with your practice, and deeply drop into the &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; of it. Beyond emphasizing its importance, Peak doesn’t go deep into how to cultivate focus. That is left to the reader. Much has been said in contemporary media about the economy of attention/distraction urbanites exist in. I won’t delve into that issue here but to ask: If it is true that we are being distracted more so than ever before, are we at risk of diminishing society’s (and our own) ability to acquire mastery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Out-of-comfort &lt;a name=&quot;ooc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberate practice requires constant tuning and shifting; we get less and less value out of revising the same material/pattern over and over again (spaced repetition learning details how to maximise that). Peak is very clear about one aspect related to this: Deliberate practice is uncomfortable. It is frustrating. We learn some aspect of a discipline. It is difficult at first. We get the hang of it. Perhaps even a little feeling of accomplishment comes our way. But then we need to do something different, harder. We probably mess up and get frustrated again. Just to keep making progress. This process can be literally fatiguing. Peak noted this fatigue in the high performing classical music students; putting in huge reps of deliberate practice and integrating afternoon naps to compensate. Obviously there is a very real skill in itself of balancing how exhausting, challenging and difficult practice is, with also making sure we are staying focused, healthy and ‘well-rounded’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Implications for education &lt;a name=&quot;educ&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education, notionally oriented to improving expertise, is the first field that the authors examine regarding the implications of Peak. Specifically, in chapter 9, they detail a trial conducted at the University of British Columbia, at the undergraduate level. Splitting a large physics course into two cohort, the study only shifted their twelfth week of instruction, on the topic of electromagnetic waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study cohort, the goal was not to just feed the students the required information for that week but to instead prompt them to practice thinking like physicists. Before each class both cohorts were prompted to read short additional material. The first difference was that the study cohort was also asked a battery of true/false online questions, that would give them immediate feedback about whether they were employing the same mental representations that a physicist ought to be. The next difference was the study cohort dropped the classic lecture style. Instead, the cohort was broken up into small groups and asked ‘clicker’ questions. These questions could be answered electronically, the answers sent straight to the instructor. Before answering, the students would be given a chance to discuss the question within their group. After the answers were submitted, the instructor would display the answers and discuss, and then answer additional questions students had. Several of these questions were asked and if a decent number of students struggled with a particular concept, the lecturer would take that as a cue to offer a mini-lecture on that topic. This question-discuss-answer-feedback loop was replicated by another ‘active learning’ task, where students wrote up short answers and the lecturers moved around the groups, dropping into different discussions. This allowed a tighter feedback loop than the traditional lecture: students were regularly tested on their concepts (without the pressure of being ‘graded’), got feedback, with some level of expert mentorship and ostensibly built up better mental representations of electromagnetic waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what was the tested difference between the study and control cohorts after this? Both cohorts received multiple-choice quiz. The control cohort averaged 41% and the study cohort averaged 74% (Random guessing would net you about 23%). That is a huge improvement. The study authors determined that it produced outcomes better than two standard deviations above the mean, overcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem&quot;&gt;Bloom’s 2 sigma problem&lt;/a&gt;. Certainly a result that I would like to see replicated in a wide cross-section of studies. This study was published in 2011, and I would be curious to know to what extent these techniques have been adopted across higher education. On p.254, the authors do touch on this subject, saying that the techniques rapidly spread across science departments at UBC… but we hear nothing about their wider dissemination from the 5-6 years between the referenced study and Peak’s publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other main line of study I would like to see more of is: would these educational models also hold for younger learners. The ‘test-and-adjust’ frame of Wieman and co’s work reminds me of another simple educational intervention, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/teaching-right-level-improve-learning&quot;&gt;“Teaching At The Right Level”&lt;/a&gt;; testing kids on specific abilities and moving them into different grade classes based on their results. The JPAL studies I just linked to are not the first time I have heard of the effectiveness of avoiding age-class bracketing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2CjPXPE&quot;&gt;The Finnish Lesson&lt;/a&gt; cites the idea of ‘teaching to the right level’ as one of the important aspects of why the Finns performed so well by international educational measures. Wieman and co’s study included a micro-level loop of ‘testing to the right level’, by testing students and slowing down when material was not understood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Implications for software engineering &lt;a name=&quot;engderp&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software engineering is not a &lt;a href=&quot;#cef&quot;&gt;“clear expertise”&lt;/a&gt; field. It is an immature discipline, relative to other technical industries like aviation, construction, and medicine. There is not a clear path to overall mastery; more so there are many paths to incomplete masteries in different sub-domains and environments. At its worst (hacker news, twitter, blog comments), this is evident in vitriolic arguments, vigilante &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gatekeeping&quot;&gt;gatekeeping&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bikeshedding&quot;&gt;‘bikeshedding’&lt;/a&gt; discussions. This is because it is a relatively new discipline, is rapidly growing and changing, and tends to forget about its history. The industry’s rapid growth means it is both difficult to determine what to be mentored on, and where to even find mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paints a rather glum outlook for the aspiring engineer or developer, wanting to pursue deliberate practice in their field. However, despite these legitimate frustrations, the industry does have several bright spots. Partial tight feedback loops are very achievable in software development. Just getting a program to run and getting some output can provide immediate and clear feedback about your efforts. I say it is partial however, since there are many pitfalls and bad habits one might not be alerted with this simple level of feedback loop. Another advantage (relative to the industries mentioned at the beginning of this section), is the bewildering array of open source and free tooling, tutorials, forums, chat channels and help available online. In part these are a direct response to the disorganized nature of computer engineering mastery; and it is certainly challenging to determine the value of feedback and advice garnered from across this mass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically for my own circumstances, it reinforces the need to practice coding regularly (partially fulfilled by this blog), continue to seek mentorship (especially since it is lacking at work) where and when I can (Hello &lt;a href=&quot;https://bradfieldcs.com/&quot;&gt;Bradfield!&lt;/a&gt;) and try to understand what mental representations I am operating with when coding.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Touching on talent, drive, motivation, opportunity, IQ and privilege&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all this discussion on deliberate practice and its importance to building expertise, I have not yet talked about the place of ‘innate talent’ (Addressed in chapter 8 of Peak). As a society, we place a great deal of focus on natural ability (or lack thereof); we tend to operate under a mental model whereby some folks just have incredible talent and many do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have it. We pigeon-hole ourselves; “I don’t have a brain for math”, “I just can’t hold a tune”, “I’m not a computer person”, “I’m just not good with people”, etc. However, one of the consistent themes of Peak is that ‘innate talent’ and ‘natural ability’ play a negligible or very limited role in expertise (to be clear, this is not to suggest that ‘talented’ people don’t exist, in the sense that ‘talented’ people are good in their domain because of their history of practice and not as some genetic blessing). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors reference the importance of deliberate practice over innate talent through examples including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r&quot;&gt;The Polgar Family&lt;/a&gt; creating-chess-genius experiment (generating three female chess geniuses in an era when women’s minds weren’t considered suitable for chess);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiments into whether folks can develop perfect pitch, widely considered as something you either had or didn’t have (In the study, some folk were successful in developing perfect pitch but not all participants);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A British study done on chess-playing children of a range of ability and IQs. It found two interesting results: for the whole cohort, practice was the biggest determiner of ability, with IQ having some impact. But for the elite playing part of the cohort, IQ played no role in ability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Peak authors consciously avoid detailing the depths of the debate about what IQ actually measures on page 227, while highlighting how IQ intersects with expertise. Seeing as IQ did have a positive correlation for the non-elite chess-kids, they posit that a higher IQ might aid someone slightly in picking up a mental representation or strategy. However, at the elite level, this slight advantage seemed to fade away; deliberate practice reigned supreme when it came to ability. Consequently, from this perspective, we should view the place of education not as some sort of unearthing of innate talent or high IQ individuals, and more as a scaffold for building up mastery across all students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If IQ is not a decisive accompaniment to deliberate practice, what then is? Peak does not go into this at length but the authors do make references to a range of internal and external factors that matter for building expertise. On the internal side, practitioners need to cultivate motivation to do practice, grit at sticking with mastery challenges, and a willingness to pursue a specific mastery. These may well be meta-skills that can also be cultivated, or innate; this is not really addressed in Peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External factors include access to mentorship, privilege and supportive community. If you cannot convince someone to mentor you, progress in your mastery will be tougher. When I say privilege in this context, I am essentially asking: how free is an individual to pursue their mastery? Do they live a monastic lifestyle, free from distractions, provided all required tools and materials to practice, fed and sheltered? Or do they have to work, be a care-giver to others, scrape together funds to buy supplies and tools? As for the presence or absence of a supportive community; these can provide external motivation (practicing with peers, encouragement from family), mentorship opportunities and resources. The book title includes a glowing quote from the Economist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”[Peak] offers an optimistic anti-determinism that ought to influence how people educate children, manage employees, and spend their time. The good news is that to excel one need only look within.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is that last sentence that I think is a misrepresentation of the sum of Peak’s findings. If we miss the importance of the factors that support and sustain deliberate practice, we risk being blind to systemic biases against some groups and their pursuit of mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implications for me!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peak feels like the coalescing of learning moments from my past. It has been a fantastic reminder that I need to put more care and time into my masteries. While I disparaged the Economist quote, I do strongly agree with its view that Peak offers an optimistic anti-determinism for humanity. Collectively, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; worth investing in building skills and education, if we heed the lessons on the research into expertise. We are not wholly the result of some genetic and circumstantial lottery. I do feel the pull between several disciplines, and I must acknowledge that splitting my time does ‘slow me down’ in any one mastery. But that feels like balance for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A confluence of factors have driven me to set up this site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wanting to clarify my thinking by writing; framing my thoughts in prose and paragraph,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wanting to have a place to publish these writings,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the desire to move more of my online life off social media and on to my own ‘platform’, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using all that as an opportunity to dabble in a few technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why: which topics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider having a board range of interesting and pursuits to be a strong foundation for living a ‘good life’. I will be covering a range of topics, touching on the mind, embodied living and the soul. Each of the different topics and their importance may warrant a deeper look at another time but I want to touch on them briefly here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Dance is the easiest&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In large part because its expression is non-verbal. When I post up some of my movement practice, I might make a comment about the context or the music. But so much of movement and dance for me is the escape from words and that way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Engineering and systems thinking&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documenting what I am learning and thinking about from a systems-design or engineering perspective. The journey into this technical domain began with my career as a geospatial analyst; a cartographer of sorts. I still get to wrestle with the challenges of the geospatial domain in my current role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Rites of Passage&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fortunate to be able to volunteer my time to lead a youth group. The organization that backs the youth group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steppingstonesproject.org/&quot;&gt;The Stepping Stones Project&lt;/a&gt; is focused on rites of passage and developing our relationships to community and nature. Their model begins with this premise; many industrialized societies have forgotten or lost the ceremony and structure around teenage rites of passage. There are deep and rich traditions of marking the transitions of our life in some areas (such as funerals and weddings). However, the marking of a transition from childhood to adolescence is sorely missing in the lives of many youth coming of age today. Stepping Stones seeks to change that. This leads to my next topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Masculinity for 21st century&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, masculinity (male gender roles) needs to be updated. And certainly not in the revisionist, retrograde fashion that some folk suggest. As intersectional feminism continues its push for multi-generational change in the roles and possibilities for women and equality for all, some men have been triggered by the uncertainty of change and the resetting of power dynamics. Operating under a scarcity mindset, from a place of fear and of understanding the world in zero-sum game terms (more for someone else, automatically means less for me), these men (and some women) yearn to return to ‘simpler’ times when gender roles were more or less fixed. I seek to articulate and build new masculinities (plural!), that adapt and integrate intersectional liberation of all people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;How humans get things done&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably my broadest topics, used as a catch all for my general fascination with how people come together, and how they get things done together. Covering both the communal, being together aspect and the productive, coordinating, collaborating aspects of groups of humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll start from here. Perhaps time will reveal some other themes that I continue to return to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👋 Welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chelsey and I visited a friend’s pre-burn party. They had built their core camp infrastructure out of shipping containers and other kit, assembled it in a warehouse and threw a party to test it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t spend long there but before it got crowded, we got to dance. Kris Roller was filming some promo style footage for the camp. Riley (Chelsey’s work buddy and bestie) came over and pulled us over to the space featured in this clip, asking us to dance for the camera. The lighting, energy of the space and Kris’ great eye and steady cam produced this little gem of us moving.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Returning from the Bodega Bay Summer Trip]]></title><description><![CDATA[Epistemic status: Reflective, anecdotal I just spent my birthday hiking up a windswept hill with my youth group, of teenage boys, and my…]]></description><link>https://twicefire.com/ritesofpassage/bodega/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://twicefire.com/ritesofpassage/bodega/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 15:11:55 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: Reflective, anecdotal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just spent my birthday hiking up a windswept hill with my youth group, of teenage boys, and my homie Chaise, instead of spending my birthday and anniversary weekend with my love Chelsey and my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future shape of humanity hangs in the balance. Who and what are we to become in this century? One facet of that is the future of “men”; men-folk, boys, lads, however we choose to identity them (/us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my journey with this group over two years ago; it was already apparent then, that the fate of men was &lt;strong&gt;‘up for grabs’&lt;/strong&gt;; contested. In part, this comes from our industrial way of living, disrupting the guidance, mentoring and rites of passage that youth commonly received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with this disruption, boys and young men can’t wait; they try to figure things out for themselves. From movies, from porn, from computer games, from memes, from internet chat boards, but mainly from their equally anchorless peers. It is a real roll of the dice in that regard. And some of them find and follow 4chan, “Men’s Rights Activists”, nihilist edge-lords, Pick Up Artists, Jordan B Peterson and other folks whose values and ideas take us backward, towards even more oppressive and stratified ways of being together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where are ‘we’? Are ‘we’ showing up for these boys? ‘We’, cis men-folk that strive to be ‘woke’. That strive to be ‘progressive’, ‘forward-thinking’, ‘conscious’, etc. Are we too caught up in our own lives; our own troubles; our own pleasures and responsibilities; to show up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, our program has a surplus of women group-leaders, more than we have girl youth; and a lack of men group-leaders for the boys that are seeking mentorship. Big Brother/Big Sister programs have dire need of Big Brothers and a oversupply of Big Sisters. Men seem to be increasingly abandoning the teaching profession. At our parent meetings, we have one father show up out of five (we have two lesbian couple families, so not counting those families for this purpose). Yesterday when the boys were picked up from the camping trip, one of the boys noted, &lt;em&gt;“None of the dads are here to pick us up”&lt;/em&gt; (although two of them dropped their boys off on Saturday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like women are showing up for youth of all genders but are ‘we’? Did we miss this mentorship, guidance and care from men-folk in our development? Are we left questioning what it even looks like, let alone how ‘we’ could provide it to the next generation of young men?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us are following and figuring out our own paths. I don’t expect all of us men-folk to contribute in the same way. But I am asking us to do more. At a minimum, work on yourself. Figure out if you missed out on a rite of passage, some mentorship or guidance, and then go and seek it out. Figure out the best traits that humans exhibit, whether they are defined as masculine or feminine, and explore your best-self through them. Don’t forget that some of the best ways to work on yourself are to help, mentor and learn with others. You can grow and heal around being ‘a man’ while working with youth and sharing in their search for what it is to be ‘a better man’. Run a youth group; coach a sports team; show up for your nephews, younger brothers, etc; try out Big Brother; be a camp counselor; Teach for America; work for nature programs… find a way, please, please, find a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steppingstonesproject.org/&quot;&gt;Stepping Stones Project&lt;/a&gt; if you can; donate your money, your time or fill one of the open roles!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Smoke and Mirrors]]></title><description><![CDATA[It only took me just over an hour to hike out to this point.
