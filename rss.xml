A model like this is useful for creating a common understanding for how organizations tend to deal with the challenges around acquiring geo-data.
&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: very specific reflections on a niche domain I have spent a lot of time operating in. Planning on adding more about metrics at a later date&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;General model for geo-data acquisition&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When seeking to describe a model for anything, a tension exists between simplifying the model down to the most essential aspects, and including nothing more. It is obviously important to detail what is in a model; less obviously, it is also critical to detail what is not included in a model or otherwise delegated to higher or lower scopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my observations of geo-data acquisition practices in the Anglo-American (“Five Eye”) intelligence community, in Terravion, an aerial imagery start up, and working for the Capture Systems team in HERE, the most essential elements for the general model for geo-data acquisition are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquisition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Requirements define what data/outcomes are needed.&lt;/em&gt; The bulk of work around requirements stems from understanding the business problem that needs to be solved, expressing that as a singular requirement or a set of requirements, and framing those requirements in a way that can be easily passed to the acquisition part of the cycle. Typically this process also includes prioritization, basic cost analysis and a way to keep requestors up to date with the ongoing status of their requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Acquisition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two broadest categories of acquisition are 1) &lt;em&gt;getting the data from someone else&lt;/em&gt; 2) &lt;em&gt;collecting it yourself.&lt;/em&gt; While there are operational differences between requesting and receiving data from an external source, versus operating one’s own collection platforms, they share a common lifecycle: requirements need to be translated into acquisition planning, and data needs to be furnished in an agreed-on format and schema. The data provider in either case ought to go through processes including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking whether they already have data to satisfy a requirement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If collection is required, breaking down requirements into a plan of specific tasks for their collection platform to execute on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collection operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collection validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If data is externally sourced, these processes tend to be shielded from other actors in the rest of the cycle. If internally sourced, the implementation details of collection platform operation can leak out all through the overall cycle, if care is not taken to effectively encapsulate the collection platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feedback is the process of matching the acquired data up to its originating requirements, and confirming whether the acquired data fulfills those requirements.&lt;/em&gt;  Often, the acquired data will undergo further processing and analysis after it has been received. Consequently, feedback may either be incremental or held up until all processing has been completed. The health or efficiency of the overall lifecycle is dependent on whether the feedback flowing back to the rest of the cycle is timely, concise and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is left out of this model?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps prior to defining requirements are left out. Figuring out what problem sets or market fit are important for an organization; this process is where requirements come from. However delving into that would be a distraction from the core cycle of the model. Similarly, steps after feedback beyond scope; how processing is done, how the data is served or archived, marketing to customers, etc. All important aspects to consider for an organization as a whole but distracting for our current focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers who are familiar with data acquisition might be wondering about some key aspect of the acquisition cycle they are familiar with, and questioning why it is not included. What about ingestion or routing? Or task orchestration? Where is the campaign management? Data integrity/security/privacy? Or quality assurance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tend to be implementation details of the wider cycle. Depending on the scale of data acquisition in an organization, it makes sense to call out more specific steps and sub-processes as they are required. In the same way that routing, fleet management and other collection operations are sub-components of the overall theme of acquisition, quality assurance, ingestion, data integrity measures, etc, are ultimately all forms of feedback. It is not uncommon for different organizations or groups to use different names (campaign management, scope management, collection orchestration) for the same function (a process to ensure requirements are turned into instructions for acquisition platforms). This cross-labelling risk applies even to this model. I have tried to establish the most generic labels for separating the major conceptual parts of the cycle, with requirements, acquisition, and feedback. Perhaps more “intuitive” terms exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is the scale of the model?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model is meant to broadly define the major de facto stages of data acquisition, whether undertaken by a small startup, multi-agency governmental community, global multi-national company or even an individual. As an individual, I might be interested in buying a rural property. In order to inform myself about the property’s potential, I might determine I want to assess the soil composition of the area and seasonal sun exposure on the property (hopefully information I can get from the local council/government). Additionally, I might even bring my drone on a visit, and get an overhead view of the spatial relationships across the property. All of this can be expressed in the frame of a generic data acquisition model: figuring out my requirements, acquiring the data from other sources or via my drone, and checking the data (perhaps in real-time on the drone’s live-video feed) against my requirements (the feedback phase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense to apply a generic data acquisition model to my interest in a property? No. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the model might generally describe what steps I take in getting geo-data related to the property, it probably will not help me catch aspects I may have missed, or otherwise have failed to coordinate. The scale of my project is so small, it easily fits inside my head. Thus, while the model can be applied to smaller scales, it is most useful when applied to larger scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the scale of a data acquisition effort increases, so increases the value of a shared, clear operating picture, good instrumentation, and data driven decision making. These things are underpinned by a clear mental model for the data acquisition cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an organization grows, its data acquisition cycle graduates from a simple process shared between a few people, to a process that involves more and more components, people and specialized responsibilities. An acquisition cycle that was small, simple and easy to understand when an organization was just getting off the ground, will likely evolve during the growth of the organization in messy and unclear ways. This organizational confusion shows up in a variety of ways, which will be addressed in the next section on common pitfalls in data acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Common challenges in the data acquisition cycle&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a non-exhaustive list of common challenges organizations encounter when scaling their data acquisition efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Requirement-related challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Skipping requirements&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there is no requirement process or individuals in an organization just skip them, the risk is that resources will be misallocated when acquiring data. This risk only increases as the number of acquisition platforms and data requestors increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete existing data check&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When requirements come in, it is wise to check against existing data holdings. If a requirement is already serviced by existing data, it should be satisfied with that. Not addressing this challenge results in the organization using resources to require unnecessary data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete prioritization system&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If requirements are not prioritized, and/or there is not a clear system by which prioritization occurs, the overall cycle will either misallocate resources to lesser requirements or be delayed as manual efforts are required to seek priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete/confusing requirements interface&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are multiple ways to submit requirements, unclear processes or poorly defined responsibilities for handling requirements, confusion will rain. The data acquisition cycle will miss requirements, misallocate resources, and fail to consistently serve the goals of the wider organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Challenges in the space between requirements and acquisition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Requirements that do not translate to clear acquisition tasks&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be coherent ways to translate requirements into tasks for an acquisition platform. The differences in how acquisition platforms operate means that this requires careful thinking and design for any requirement coordinating system. Failure to achieve this means that acquisition platforms will be mis-tasked (thus wasting resources and missing opportunities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Lack of knowledge about acquisition platform particulars&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every data acquisition system will attempt to abstract the differences between acquisition platforms, and even the differences between individual instances of those platforms. If the requirements system does not allow the articulation of requirements that use the full capabilities of an acquisition platform, the organization will end up missing out on those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Acquisition-related challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete orchestration&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orchestration is the process whereby collections of requirements are compared to see which ones overlap or are complimentary, allowing for a more efficient set of tasks to be provided to an acquisition platform. Naïve orchestration will create tasks that are nearly identical, duplicating effort and wasting resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Collection anomalies&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every acquisition platform will have anomalies and edge-cases that will make its output less useful. Whether this is atmospheric conditions for clouds, road closures for road-based collectors or software glitches, these errors and blips are a given. Making sure these are tracked and mitigated is a common challenge in data acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback-related challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Skip feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipping a systemic approach to feedback works fine for small scale operations; verbal or ad-hoc feedback about data problems suffices. This does not work as an organization scales. Skipping feedback ultimately just pushes this work on to your customers/end-users, except by that stage there may be no effective way to trace problems back to their origin in the data acquisition cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Slow feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer requirements are left open or acquisition platforms are left without completion feedback, the longer they are left in an unclear state. This can impact orchestration (for example: do you include a requirement in orchestration today, when it was meant to be collected last week but you don’t know if that collection worked?), and otherwise lowers agility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting effective feedback on what acquisition tasks have been completed but not which requirements have been satisfied, or vice-versa, are examples of incomplete feedback. Failing to address this will undermine different decision points throughout the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Deidentified feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the data identities are not meaningfully tracked through the data acquisition cycle, feedback becomes a challenging forensic process. If someone comes to you and states “these pieces of data are corrupted” and there are not ways to easily identify which task they were acquired by, which requirements they relate to or which acquisition platform they stem from, debugging what is going wrong becomes a time-consuming feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incremental feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing acquired data can require several stages and take time. Some parts of the data might be finished before others. This can make it difficult to define when an acquisition task or a requirement is “done”. If this detail is not ironed out, it can result in confusing statistics on the progress of data acquisition, leading to chaotic decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wider challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Lack of shared understanding of an organization’s data acquisition cycle&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If individuals working within the data acquisition cycle do not share a common understanding of the cycle, trouble-shooting issues and improving the cycle becomes chaotic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete privacy controls&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquired data can easily include ways to identify individuals and risk breaching their privacy. For both moral and legal reasons, having a system wide awareness of privacy matters is the only way to mitigate the risk of privacy breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete security controls&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, system wide security awareness ought to be calibrated to the level of risk. Sufficiently large scale technology companies should consider their networks compromised and secure internally on that assumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Misalignment between requirement, acquisition and feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge tends to show up when data acquisition cycles undergo great change in their requirements or access to acquisition platforms. Understanding of new demands or new/lost acquisition platforms has not spread sufficiently across people and systems involved in the whole cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Process duplication&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process duplication is when there are multiple parts an organization repeating the same functionality in the data acquisition cycle, or the organization has completely separate data acquisition cycles co-existing. Acquisition platforms will proliferate, if they have justifiably different capabilities and use-cases. It’s harder to justify having multiple requirement-management or feedback systems; proliferating these tends to cause chaos, as requestors have to petition multiple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Complex coupling&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When different parts of the acquisition cycle are coupling in complex ways, making changes to the different sub-sections or adding new sub-sections to the overall cycle becomes awkward. Changes in one system can cause problems downstream. A common time this becomes apparent is when the acquisition cycle revolves around a particular platform, and then a new platform is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Priors: Mental Models]]></title><description><![CDATA[I use “Mental models” as a shorthand term for the idea that the way a single human mind comprehends reality, is not reality.

It is the distinction that the way we think about something is not the totality of that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation&quot;&gt;“The map is not the territory”&lt;/a&gt; is the most common expression of this idea. Why is it important to note this distinction? If we forget the distinction, we end up thinking that our perception of reality &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; actually reality. The negative consequence of letting that replacement happen is we lose touch with reality, and as conditions and circumstances change, we fail to adjust our thinking and actions to our context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why can’t we know the totality of a thing or reality itself?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the totality of a thing, or reality itself requires omniscience: total knowledge and understanding over time. Human cognition currently seems ill-equipped for such a task. &lt;em&gt;;) sly wink&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Limited sensory ability&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, our senses provide us with an assortment of limited inputs. Our cognitive processes transform these disparate streams into an astoundingly impressive illusion. Take our vision for example. A simple mental model of our vision imagines it to be like a camera, scanning the outside world and capturing everything it sees, pixel for pixel. The reality is that we can only actively see a tiny part of our field of vision at any time, and our brains are otherwise generating a cohesive view of the world &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception&quot;&gt;(see this entry on Visual Perception for more detail)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are essentially perceiving only a tiny part of everything around us. Meanwhile, our brain is predicting everything else in our sensory field, trying to make a coherent scene out of it all. At this extreme, our brain is creating a mental model of the reality that is all around us. It is built up on thousands of hours of observation and experimentation as infants: dropping our spoons from our high chairs; standing; falling; making noises that echo off walls; grasping any object placed in our tiny hands. We inherit a bunch of our initial stimuli responses from our genetics but largely we learn them as we transition from being a tiny zygote in the womb, into a proto-consciousness and beyond. We tend to take it for granted, that each of us has developed this rich and detailed model of reality. It is truly a marvel if one looks closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Does ‘objective’ reality exist?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Objective’ reality is mediated by our mental model of it. Strictly speaking, that is not very objective at all. Does objective reality exist then? I posit that, functionally, yes it does exist. Without diving off the metaphysical or spiritual deep-ends, we come into this existence as a sensing/thinking/feeling entity, tumbling around in a chaotic mess of sensory inputs, and we consistently unpickle that mess into understandings about the physical world, language, human interactions, abstract concepts and much more. Of course, once we start layering in language, social interactions and abstract concepts, we start proliferating all sorts of mental models to make sense of the inter-subjective part of our existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While language can help us share abstract mental models, like the concept of a divine spirit, a nation-state, or a company, that homo sapien super-power is not sufficient to overcome the perceptual barrier between our cognition and objective reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;What are the practical outcomes of thinking in ‘mental models’?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging that even strongly held concepts about the world are only partial representations; inaccurate in some way we can’t see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging that any model of the world is going to be some sort of simplification of what is going on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discernment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While these factors mean that we accept that all models are wrong, we can also determine that some models are more ‘useful’ than others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We see two means of understanding the usefulness of a model: Korzybski links usefulness to the model having a ‘similar structure’ to reality, thus allowing us to make predictions and acts upon it. Harari stated a related case for thinking of usefulness as power; how much power could be derived from a model of reality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to consciously switch into thinking about a situation with a different mental model; that of the person standing in front of you, of a different political belief, of different school of thought. (Of course, we must acknowledge that there are mental models we hold that we cannot shake and that we might not know which or what they are.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting a more holistic view of a situation by looking at it with several mental models.&lt;/li&gt;

Or what you, as a novice of any mastery, could learn from that? If your ‘lack of talent’ is holding you back from taking up singing, carpentry or computer programming? Whether talent even exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“…Secrets from the new science of expertise”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: I have spent some time looking at expertise, starting with physical skill acquisition. Read this book thoroughly but have not yet looked into all my research leads around expertise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an interest in getting better at your pursuits, skills and masteries, read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Peak, Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool have set out to both study and concisely present research into the question of how do humans ‘get better at stuff’. Peak seeks to breakdown the research being conducted in the field, add in some little stories to flesh the ideas and concepts out and also wades into some of the implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key concepts the book discusses are &lt;strong&gt;deliberate practice, mental representation, mentorship, and feedback.&lt;/strong&gt; I found the book very engaging, due to my interest in this domain and that it was quite disgestable to me; linking to my strong priors, such as &lt;em&gt;mental models, tight feedback loops, mentorship&lt;/em&gt; from a rites of passage frame and prior reading about &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt;. In essence, we build mastery most effectively by undertaking focused, limits-of-ability practice, either under direct coaching (mentorship) or after developing powerful &lt;em&gt;mental representations&lt;/em&gt; that allow for masterful &lt;em&gt;feedback&lt;/em&gt;. There are specific conditions attached to these general terms: you can’t just do one aspect of deliberate practice and expect to progress. So I will unpack some of those aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Deliberate practice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should I care about deliberate practice? Two major drives for acquiring a skill include wanting to survive and, for the sheer joy of its mastery. If you really want to excel at surviving (hey, some of us are quite keen on living) or simply love getting better at the hobbies and disciplines we practice, deliberate practice is something we should be engaging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I need to work at getting better at stuff, right, of course… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What one needs to take from the idea of deliberate practice is that just putting in hours of practice is not enough; there are specific conditions that need to happen for it to be fully effective. For illustrative purposes, I’ll list some of the things that lead us to ‘degraded practice’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go through the motions; we stop paying attention to our practice; we don’t get expert mentorship; we do not analyse our practice to get self-feedback; and … we bail on practice altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we place the two on a spectrum, what does it take to push us from the ‘degraded practice’ end of a spectrum, to the deliberate practice end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a clearly defined and well established path to mastery, with easily identifiable experts; I am labelling these &lt;a href=&quot;#cef&quot;&gt;“Clear expertise fields”&lt;/a&gt;, something not common to all fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#mentor&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/a&gt; from teachers/masters of the discipline; adjusting if a teacher can no longer push you beyond your limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meaningful, regular &lt;a href=&quot;#feed&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#menrep&quot;&gt;Mental representations&lt;/a&gt;, that allow one to self-correct errors during practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued &lt;a href=&quot;#foc&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; during practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ooc&quot;&gt;Practice that is ‘difficult’&lt;/a&gt;; it continues to push your boundaries, even if this is exhausting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;“Clear expertise” fields &lt;a name=&quot;cef&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fields tend to have two main qualities. 1) The field is already well-developed, so expectations about mastery and paths to achieving that are already well-defined. and 2) the field has direct competition and rankings that make it ‘easy’ to compare practitioners. Examples of this span chess, classical music, all sorts of sports but particularly individual sports, martial arts, and structured forms of dance. As the authors say on p.98, “What doesn’t qualify?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much anything in which there is no or little direct competition, such as gardening … [being a] business manager, teacher, electrician, engineer, consultant, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is somewhat unfortunate if you care muchly about one of those “excluded” fields, something I will explore later with software engineering. I would also argue to include aviation, medicine, civil engineering and similar as ‘clear expertise’ fields; fields that do not have competition perse but that have well defined metrics (often with life or death consequences!) by which to gauge interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Mentorship &lt;a name=&quot;mentor&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentors guide you on your path to mastery. They often set one’s curriculum, shift the focus of practice and, most importantly, they provide rapid, accurate feedback on errors. Getting accurate and speedy feedback is one of the most powerful mechanisms in human experience. It is the essential underpinning of how we learn to navigate reality overtime. Mentors greatly improve this feedback process, particularly if the discipline is well understood. Beyond their instructive guidance, a broader sense of being mentored by someone no doubt has benefits to motivation and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Feedback &lt;a name=&quot;feed&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are constantly predicting what will happen around us and correcting our expectations based on sensory input. The feedback we glean from practice and from our mentors is just a more built-up version of this. While mentor feedback is very valuable, to pursue excellence, one must figure out how to give oneself worthwhile feedback. This leads us to …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Mental representations &lt;a name=&quot;menrep&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson and Pool place great importance on their concept of &lt;em&gt;mental representations&lt;/em&gt;. They are important because they must be developed by practitioners for them to be able to critique themselves. Think of how a musician can glance at a score and immediate develop a ‘sense’ of how it should sound. A dancer feeling the stickiness of their last sequence and knowing that they did not quite nail it. A chess master or a professional soccer player can look at a snapshot of their respective fields of play and predict what will happen next. Mental representations also define how we structure our skills and their interrelated parts in our minds. Like how a guitarist will structure collections of notes into chords and progressions. I would add that “clear expertise” fields probably have defined mental representations formally, and have them shared across the whole discipline. Where as in other less mature/structured fields, there are a multitude of bespoke mental representations going around and it becomes unclear how easily concepts can be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Focus &lt;a name=&quot;foc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to stick with your practice, and deeply drop into the &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; of it. Beyond emphasizing its importance, Peak doesn’t go deep into how to cultivate focus. That is left to the reader. Much has been said in contemporary media about the economy of attention/distraction urbanites exist in. I won’t delve into that issue here but to ask: If it is true that we are being distracted more so than ever before, are we at risk of diminishing society’s (and our own) ability to acquire mastery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Out-of-comfort &lt;a name=&quot;ooc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberate practice requires constant tuning and shifting; we get less and less value out of revising the same material/pattern over and over again (spaced repetition learning details how to maximise that). Peak is very clear about one aspect related to this: Deliberate practice is uncomfortable. It is frustrating. We learn some aspect of a discipline. It is difficult at first. We get the hang of it. Perhaps even a little feeling of accomplishment comes our way. But then we need to do something different, harder. We probably mess up and get frustrated again. Just to keep making progress. This process can be literally fatiguing. Peak noted this fatigue in the high performing classical music students; putting in huge reps of deliberate practice and integrating afternoon naps to compensate. Obviously there is a very real skill in itself of balancing how exhausting, challenging and difficult practice is, with also making sure we are staying focused, healthy and ‘well-rounded’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Implications for education &lt;a name=&quot;educ&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education, notionally oriented to improving expertise, is the first field that the authors examine regarding the implications of Peak. Specifically, in chapter 9, they detail a trial conducted at the University of British Columbia, at the undergraduate level. Splitting a large physics course into two cohort, the study only shifted their twelfth week of instruction, on the topic of electromagnetic waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study cohort, the goal was not to just feed the students the required information for that week but to instead prompt them to practice thinking like physicists. Before each class both cohorts were prompted to read short additional material. The first difference was that the study cohort was also asked a battery of true/false online questions, that would give them immediate feedback about whether they were employing the same mental representations that a physicist ought to be. The next difference was the study cohort dropped the classic lecture style. Instead, the cohort was broken up into small groups and asked ‘clicker’ questions. These questions could be answered electronically, the answers sent straight to the instructor. Before answering, the students would be given a chance to discuss the question within their group. After the answers were submitted, the instructor would display the answers and discuss, and then answer additional questions students had. Several of these questions were asked and if a decent number of students struggled with a particular concept, the lecturer would take that as a cue to offer a mini-lecture on that topic. This question-discuss-answer-feedback loop was replicated by another ‘active learning’ task, where students wrote up short answers and the lecturers moved around the groups, dropping into different discussions. This allowed a tighter feedback loop than the traditional lecture: students were regularly tested on their concepts (without the pressure of being ‘graded’), got feedback, with some level of expert mentorship and ostensibly built up better mental representations of electromagnetic waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what was the tested difference between the study and control cohorts after this? Both cohorts received multiple-choice quiz. The control cohort averaged 41% and the study cohort averaged 74% (Random guessing would net you about 23%). That is a huge improvement. The study authors determined that it produced outcomes better than two standard deviations above the mean, overcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem&quot;&gt;Bloom’s 2 sigma problem&lt;/a&gt;. Certainly a result that I would like to see replicated in a wide cross-section of studies. This study was published in 2011, and I would be curious to know to what extent these techniques have been adopted across higher education. On p.254, the authors do touch on this subject, saying that the techniques rapidly spread across science departments at UBC… but we hear nothing about their wider dissemination from the 5-6 years between the referenced study and Peak’s publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other main line of study I would like to see more of is: would these educational models also hold for younger learners. The ‘test-and-adjust’ frame of Wieman and co’s work reminds me of another simple educational intervention, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/teaching-right-level-improve-learning&quot;&gt;“Teaching At The Right Level”&lt;/a&gt;; testing kids on specific abilities and moving them into different grade classes based on their results. The JPAL studies I just linked to are not the first time I have heard of the effectiveness of avoiding age-class bracketing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2CjPXPE&quot;&gt;The Finnish Lesson&lt;/a&gt; cites the idea of ‘teaching to the right level’ as one of the important aspects of why the Finns performed so well by international educational measures. Wieman and co’s study included a micro-level loop of ‘testing to the right level’, by testing students and slowing down when material was not understood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Implications for software engineering &lt;a name=&quot;engderp&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software engineering is not a &lt;a href=&quot;#cef&quot;&gt;“clear expertise”&lt;/a&gt; field. It is an immature discipline, relative to other technical industries like aviation, construction, and medicine. There is not a clear path to overall mastery; more so there are many paths to incomplete masteries in different sub-domains and environments. At its worst (hacker news, twitter, blog comments), this is evident in vitriolic arguments, vigilante &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gatekeeping&quot;&gt;gatekeeping&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bikeshedding&quot;&gt;‘bikeshedding’&lt;/a&gt; discussions. This is because it is a relatively new discipline, is rapidly growing and changing, and tends to forget about its history. The industry’s rapid growth means it is both difficult to determine what to be mentored on, and where to even find mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paints a rather glum outlook for the aspiring engineer or developer, wanting to pursue deliberate practice in their field. However, despite these legitimate frustrations, the industry does have several bright spots. Partial tight feedback loops are very achievable in software development. Just getting a program to run and getting some output can provide immediate and clear feedback about your efforts. I say it is partial however, since there are many pitfalls and bad habits one might not be alerted with this simple level of feedback loop. Another advantage (relative to the industries mentioned at the beginning of this section), is the bewildering array of open source and free tooling, tutorials, forums, chat channels and help available online. In part these are a direct response to the disorganized nature of computer engineering mastery; and it is certainly challenging to determine the value of feedback and advice garnered from across this mass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically for my own circumstances, it reinforces the need to practice coding regularly (partially fulfilled by this blog), continue to seek mentorship (especially since it is lacking at work) where and when I can (Hello &lt;a href=&quot;https://bradfieldcs.com/&quot;&gt;Bradfield!&lt;/a&gt;) and try to understand what mental representations I am operating with when coding.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Touching on talent, drive, motivation, opportunity, IQ and privilege&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all this discussion on deliberate practice and its importance to building expertise, I have not yet talked about the place of ‘innate talent’ (Addressed in chapter 8 of Peak). As a society, we place a great deal of focus on natural ability (or lack thereof); we tend to operate under a mental model whereby some folks just have incredible talent and many do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have it. We pigeon-hole ourselves; “I don’t have a brain for math”, “I just can’t hold a tune”, “I’m not a computer person”, “I’m just not good with people”, etc. However, one of the consistent themes of Peak is that ‘innate talent’ and ‘natural ability’ play a negligible or very limited role in expertise (to be clear, this is not to suggest that ‘talented’ people don’t exist, in the sense that ‘talented’ people are good in their domain because of their history of practice and not as some genetic blessing). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors reference the importance of deliberate practice over innate talent through examples including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r&quot;&gt;The Polgar Family&lt;/a&gt; creating-chess-genius experiment (generating three female chess geniuses in an era when women’s minds weren’t considered suitable for chess);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiments into whether folks can develop perfect pitch, widely considered as something you either had or didn’t have (In the study, some folk were successful in developing perfect pitch but not all participants);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A British study done on chess-playing children of a range of ability and IQs. It found two interesting results: for the whole cohort, practice was the biggest determiner of ability, with IQ having some impact. But for the elite playing part of the cohort, IQ played no role in ability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Peak authors consciously avoid detailing the depths of the debate about what IQ actually measures on page 227, while highlighting how IQ intersects with expertise. Seeing as IQ did have a positive correlation for the non-elite chess-kids, they posit that a higher IQ might aid someone slightly in picking up a mental representation or strategy. However, at the elite level, this slight advantage seemed to fade away; deliberate practice reigned supreme when it came to ability. Consequently, from this perspective, we should view the place of education not as some sort of unearthing of innate talent or high IQ individuals, and more as a scaffold for building up mastery across all students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If IQ is not a decisive accompaniment to deliberate practice, what then is? Peak does not go into this at length but the authors do make references to a range of internal and external factors that matter for building expertise. On the internal side, practitioners need to cultivate motivation to do practice, grit at sticking with mastery challenges, and a willingness to pursue a specific mastery. These may well be meta-skills that can also be cultivated, or innate; this is not really addressed in Peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External factors include access to mentorship, privilege and supportive community. If you cannot convince someone to mentor you, progress in your mastery will be tougher. When I say privilege in this context, I am essentially asking: how free is an individual to pursue their mastery? Do they live a monastic lifestyle, free from distractions, provided all required tools and materials to practice, fed and sheltered? Or do they have to work, be a care-giver to others, scrape together funds to buy supplies and tools? As for the presence or absence of a supportive community; these can provide external motivation (practicing with peers, encouragement from family), mentorship opportunities and resources. The book title includes a glowing quote from the Economist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”[Peak] offers an optimistic anti-determinism that ought to influence how people educate children, manage employees, and spend their time. The good news is that to excel one need only look within.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is that last sentence that I think is a misrepresentation of the sum of Peak’s findings. If we miss the importance of the factors that support and sustain deliberate practice, we risk being blind to systemic biases against some groups and their pursuit of mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implications for me!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peak feels like the coalescing of learning moments from my past. It has been a fantastic reminder that I need to put more care and time into my masteries. While I disparaged the Economist quote, I do strongly agree with its view that Peak offers an optimistic anti-determinism for humanity. Collectively, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; worth investing in building skills and education, if we heed the lessons on the research into expertise. We are not wholly the result of some genetic and circumstantial lottery. I do feel the pull between several disciplines, and I must acknowledge that splitting my time does ‘slow me down’ in any one mastery. But that feels like balance for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A confluence of factors have driven me to set up this site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wanting to clarify my thinking by writing; framing my thoughts in prose and paragraph,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wanting to have a place to publish these writings,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the desire to move more of my online life off social media and on to my own ‘platform’, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using all that as an opportunity to dabble in a few technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why: which topics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider having a board range of interesting and pursuits to be a strong foundation for living a ‘good life’. I will be covering a range of topics, touching on the mind, embodied living and the soul. Each of the different topics and their importance may warrant a deeper look at another time but I want to touch on them briefly here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Dance is the easiest&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In large part because its expression is non-verbal. When I post up some of my movement practice, I might make a comment about the context or the music. But so much of movement and dance for me is the escape from words and that way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Engineering and systems thinking&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documenting what I am learning and thinking about from a systems-design or engineering perspective. The journey into this technical domain began with my career as a geospatial analyst; a cartographer of sorts. I still get to wrestle with the challenges of the geospatial domain in my current role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Rites of Passage&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fortunate to be able to volunteer my time to lead a youth group. The organization that backs the youth group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steppingstonesproject.org/&quot;&gt;The Stepping Stones Project&lt;/a&gt; is focused on rites of passage and developing our relationships to community and nature. Their model begins with this premise; many industrialized societies have forgotten or lost the ceremony and structure around teenage rites of passage. There are deep and rich traditions of marking the transitions of our life in some areas (such as funerals and weddings). However, the marking of a transition from childhood to adolescence is sorely missing in the lives of many youth coming of age today. Stepping Stones seeks to change that. This leads to my next topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Masculinity for 21st century&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, masculinity (male gender roles) needs to be updated. And certainly not in the revisionist, retrograde fashion that some folk suggest. As intersectional feminism continues its push for multi-generational change in the roles and possibilities for women and equality for all, some men have been triggered by the uncertainty of change and the resetting of power dynamics. Operating under a scarcity mindset, from a place of fear and of understanding the world in zero-sum game terms (more for someone else, automatically means less for me), these men (and some women) yearn to return to ‘simpler’ times when gender roles were more or less fixed. I seek to articulate and build new masculinities (plural!), that adapt and integrate intersectional liberation of all people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;How humans get things done&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably my broadest topics, used as a catch all for my general fascination with how people come together, and how they get things done together. Covering both the communal, being together aspect and the productive, coordinating, collaborating aspects of groups of humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll start from here. Perhaps time will reveal some other themes that I continue to return to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👋 Welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chelsey and I visited a friend’s pre-burn party. They had built their core camp infrastructure out of shipping containers and other kit, assembled it in a warehouse and threw a party to test it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t spend long there but before it got crowded, we got to dance. Kris Roller was filming some promo style footage for the camp. Riley (Chelsey’s work buddy and bestie) came over and pulled us over to the space featured in this clip, asking us to dance for the camera. The lighting, energy of the space and Kris’ great eye and steady cam produced this little gem of us moving.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Returning from the Bodega Bay Summer Trip]]></title><description><![CDATA[Epistemic status: Reflective, anecdotal I just spent my birthday hiking up a windswept hill with my youth group, of teenage boys, and my…]]></description><link>https://twicefire.com/bodega/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://twicefire.com/bodega/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 15:11:55 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: Reflective, anecdotal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just spent my birthday hiking up a windswept hill with my youth group, of teenage boys, and my homie Chaise, instead of spending my birthday and anniversary weekend with my love Chelsey and my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future shape of humanity hangs in the balance. Who and what are we to become in this century? One facet of that is the future of “men”; men-folk, boys, lads, however we choose to identity them (/us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my journey with this group over two years ago; it was already apparent then, that the fate of men was &lt;strong&gt;‘up for grabs’&lt;/strong&gt;; contested. In part, this comes from our industrial way of living, disrupting the guidance, mentoring and rites of passage that youth commonly received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with this disruption, boys and young men can’t wait; they try to figure things out for themselves. From movies, from porn, from computer games, from memes, from internet chat boards, but mainly from their equally anchorless peers. It is a real roll of the dice in that regard. And some of them find and follow 4chan, “Men’s Rights Activists”, nihilist edge-lords, Pick Up Artists, Jordan B Peterson and other folks whose values and ideas take us backward, towards even more oppressive and stratified ways of being together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where are ‘we’? Are ‘we’ showing up for these boys? ‘We’, cis men-folk that strive to be ‘woke’. That strive to be ‘progressive’, ‘forward-thinking’, ‘conscious’, etc. Are we too caught up in our own lives; our own troubles; our own pleasures and responsibilities; to show up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, our program has a surplus of women group-leaders, more than we have girl youth; and a lack of men group-leaders for the boys that are seeking mentorship. Big Brother/Big Sister programs have dire need of Big Brothers and a oversupply of Big Sisters. Men seem to be increasingly abandoning the teaching profession. At our parent meetings, we have one father show up out of five (we have two lesbian couple families, so not counting those families for this purpose). Yesterday when the boys were picked up from the camping trip, one of the boys noted, &lt;em&gt;“None of the dads are here to pick us up”&lt;/em&gt; (although two of them dropped their boys off on Saturday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like women are showing up for youth of all genders but are ‘we’? Did we miss this mentorship, guidance and care from men-folk in our development? Are we left questioning what it even looks like, let alone how ‘we’ could provide it to the next generation of young men?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us are following and figuring out our own paths. I don’t expect all of us men-folk to contribute in the same way. But I am asking us to do more. At a minimum, work on yourself. Figure out if you missed out on a rite of passage, some mentorship or guidance, and then go and seek it out. Figure out the best traits that humans exhibit, whether they are defined as masculine or feminine, and explore your best-self through them. Don’t forget that some of the best ways to work on yourself are to help, mentor and learn with others. You can grow and heal around being ‘a man’ while working with youth and sharing in their search for what it is to be ‘a better man’. Run a youth group; coach a sports team; show up for your nephews, younger brothers, etc; try out Big Brother; be a camp counselor; Teach for America; work for nature programs… find a way, please, please, find a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steppingstonesproject.org/&quot;&gt;Stepping Stones Project&lt;/a&gt; if you can; donate your money, your time or fill one of the open roles!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Smoke and Mirrors]]></title><description><![CDATA[It only took me just over an hour to hike out to this point.
