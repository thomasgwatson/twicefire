&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is one of the several artificial intelligence tools that have pushed their way into the public consciousness in the last year. Users submit prompts via text input, and ChatGPT tried to answer, within the bounds of its ‘guard-rails’ and the canon of material it has been trained on. ChatGPT, ‘remembers’ context from earlier in conversations and the user can layer questions and prompts on each other as the conversation/dialogue continues. You can play with ChatGPT and learn about it &lt;a href=&quot;https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For a lark, I was curious how much ChatGPT knew about bioregionalism and how solidly it might grasp questions about it. I’ll share my prompts (in header form), its responses and my reflections below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What is bioregionalism?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioregionalism is a philosophy and social movement that emphasises the connection between people and the natural environment in which they live. It seeks to foster a sense of place and a sense of belonging to a specific geographic region, and to promote sustainable and self-sufficient communities that are adapted to the unique natural and cultural characteristics of their region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioregionalism advocates for the creation of bioregions, which are defined by natural features such as mountains, rivers, and vegetation, rather than by political boundaries. It promotes the idea that people should live in harmony with the natural systems of their bioregion and should make use of the resources available to them in a way that is sustainable and does not harm the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioregionalism also emphasises the importance of local decision-making and local control, and advocates for decentralisation and grassroots organising. It promotes the idea that people should be actively engaged in the management and stewardship of their local environment and should work together to solve local problems and meet local needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioregionalism has inspired a range of initiatives, including the development of sustainable communities, the promotion of local food systems, the protection of natural habitats, and the development of alternative economic and political models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Commentary&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty solid all up, even if I baulk at some of the terminology. Expressions I would avoid or employ in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘self-sufficient’, since I think, in its pure form, it is an impractical utopian goal. But moving in the direction of greater regional sufficiency is very much the vibe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘local control’. Compared to typical political ‘group-think’ in Western democracies, which deattaches us from the local and gets us to focus on the federal/national level, yes, bioregionalism is very much about focusing peeps on their region. However, one bioregion exercising ‘local control’ and changing the flow of a river, impacting the bioregions downstream… that’s not it. Managing watersheds collectively, something I think is critical for bioregionalism, would really stretch the concept of ‘local control’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How can we map bioregions?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways to map bioregions, depending on the specific goals and characteristics of the region being mapped. Here are a few approaches that are commonly used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural features: Bioregions can be mapped based on natural features such as mountains, rivers, vegetation, and climate. This approach can help to identify areas that share similar physical characteristics and that may be subject to similar ecological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cultural and historical ties: Bioregions can also be mapped based on cultural and historical ties, such as shared language, traditions, and ways of life. This approach can help to identify areas that have a shared sense of identity and that may have a shared history or cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecological systems: Bioregions can be mapped based on ecological systems, such as ecosystems, biomes, or ecological niches. This approach can help to identify areas that support particular types of plants and animals and that may be subject to similar ecological pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resource use and management: Bioregions can also be mapped based on patterns of resource use and management, such as land use, resource extraction, and environmental impacts. This approach can help to identify areas that have similar resource management challenges and that may be suitable for collaborative resource management efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many different tools and techniques that can be used to map bioregions, including GIS (geographic information systems), satellite imagery, and field surveys. It is important to consider the specific goals of the mapping effort and to choose the most appropriate tools and techniques for the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Commentary&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scatteredness of this answer reflections the corpus of information out there. Collectively there isn’t one defined way to map bioregions. I do notice the lack of explicit mentions of watersheds, even if rivers are touched on. The answer here seems vaguely on topic but not particularly insightful or interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Why don’t people understand the importance of bioregions?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why people may not understand the importance of bioregions. Here are a few possible reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of awareness: Many people may not be aware of bioregions and the concept of place-based living. They may not have learned about bioregions in school or through other educational experiences, and they may not have encountered the idea in mainstream media or popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disconnection from nature: Some people may live in urban or suburban areas where they are disconnected from the natural environment and may not have opportunities to experience the unique features and characteristics of their bioregion. This can make it difficult for them to understand the importance of place and the value of living in harmony with the natural world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on global issues: Some people may be more focused on global issues, such as international politics, economics, or social justice, and may not consider the importance of local or regional issues. This can make it difficult for them to understand the relevance of bioregions and the ways in which they can contribute to the well-being of their local community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misconceptions about bioregionalism: Some people may have misconceptions about bioregionalism or may misunderstand its goals and values. They may see it as narrow-minded or isolationist, or they may not understand how it relates to broader issues of sustainability and social justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to increase awareness and understanding of bioregions and the importance of place-based living. Some approaches include education and outreach efforts, such as public talks, workshops, and events, and the development of resources and materials that explain the concepts and values of bioregionalism in an accessible and engaging way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Commentary&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This response was the most generative for me; it inspired the most reflection. I gave space to the discoverability issues that bioregionalism faces via search-engines in earlier bioregionalism posts (And, I have to say that ChatGPT provides a better return on someone’s twenty minute investment into research on bioregionalism). But I haven’t given much space to the other concepts or ideas competing with bioregionalism. Yes, lack of awareness is the absolute baseline challenge, and I doubt we’ll be squeaking bioregionalism into school curriculum anytime soon (although now you got me thinking…). Following along the ChatGPT response, I don’t think misconceptions about bioregionalism are truly much of an issue; few even know the term, and it’s rather difficult to have misconceptions about something one has never heard of. But disconnection from nature and a focus on ‘global’ or other issues are salient problems I haven’t spoken to, and that got me thinking about some of the competing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Disconnection from nature&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioregionalism is both blocked by and an answer to our disconnection from nature. I think there are lots of people that are concerned about the impacts of climate chaos, that do not have a strong bond with nature, to place, or to our individual place in our local ecologies. And I include myself in that category; albeit I am working on it. Modernity, and arguably Post-modernity, are “the water we swim in”, conceptually. This broadly underpins so much of how we operate and think, without us collectively understanding their impact and influence. And both of those tend to place ‘man’ as separate from ‘nature’. Even some well-meaning environmentalists, seeing the havoc humanity has wrought on landscapes, argue for the de facto erasure of humanity from these landscapes, as a return to their ‘nature’ state. One of the worst outcomes of this extreme is when ‘environmental’ reasons are used to strip indigenous ways of being from a place and its peoples. This too is an example of humanity’s current separation from ‘nature’. Bioregionalism needs to place humanity into its rightful context; we are nature, we need to be integrated into the places and regions we reside and live in. And we need to be stewards of those places.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Global issues&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t really think the particular ‘global’ issues suggested by ChatGPT are particularly relevant, but the various non-local orientations of folks are somewhat obstacles for getting them to think bioregionally. The different flavours of non-local orientations include the normie ones like “the national-level drama-rama”, and “just vibing” orientations and more esoteric ones such as “terminally online”, “Living in the Metaverse”, “Living in the past”, “Narrow optimizers” and “Ad Astra”. I will flesh out each of these orientations and detail how they can deflect the concepts of bioregionalism away from folks. &lt;em&gt;Side-note: I would say it’s rare for someone to be completely absorbed or aligned with one of these orientations and that we tend to end up with a primary one, and a taste of others, and this also shifts over our lives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Just vibing&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain subset of humanity and also a certain subset of each of our lives, when we are ‘just vibing’. We are absorbed in the now, the present, the “what is”. No fucks are given, ignorance is bliss and fatalism abounds… I actually think it’s a healthy state to visit from time to time, and trying to coordinate, shift or work with folks that are stuck in this mode all the time is a lost cause. One can certainly argue that different societal factors are contributing to this orientation, and there are ways to shift the prevalence of apathy in our societies. However, that’s a sticky and complex thing in its own right. Included in the ‘just vibing’ contingent are ‘perfect consumers’. There are a lot of marketing departments spending big resources to funnel the psychological needs and yearning of society into endless-consumption. So while there is an emergent level of ‘just-vibing’ in any population, there are serious efforts to build and take advantage of this segment.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;The national-level drama-rama&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks wrapped up in this orientation have the impulse to be ‘informed about what is going on’, but that impulse is subsumed into the noise and drama of national-level affairs. The USA perhaps sees the defining pinnacle of this orientation; the interpretation of everything, whether local, international or even in a foreign country, through the lens of American federal politics, aka Blue vs Red, Dems vs Repubs. National level media reinforces this, pitching up the melodrama of Federal/National level politics to the abandonment of all else. Witness the exhausting obsession with the presidential primaries and then the presidential election itself. Folks who are completely absorbed in this melodrama won’t notice or act on local issues or otherwise align with the things that matter in bioregionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Terminally Online&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many manifestations of being terminally-online. I like the internet. It has been a part of my life since I was very young, an amazing trove of information and knowledge and communication. And there is a way one can be completely wrapped up in everything we can learn about the world via the internet that it can take us away from the immediacy of our lived experiences. I can certainly look at myself as being in the ‘at-risk’ category of the terminally-online. Some examples of the different manifestations of being terminally-online; extensive doom-scrolling on Twitter (knowing who the ‘main character’ is on twitter daily), sinking one’s heart and soul into global conspiracies (eg, QAnon) via telegram, or endless insta/facie/tiktok video loops. With all of this living ‘rent-free’, as the terminally-online would say, in one’s head, what space do we have to build relationship to the place where we are?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Living in the Metaverse&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This orientation is similar to terminally online, in that it is anchored in the internet and the ‘cyber-realm’. But instead of it being focused on the internet that relates or is a direct commentary on the world at large, it is instead focused on the worlds and realities that exist only in cyber-space. The escape of computer games, of MMOs, of Stardew Valley, of fan-fiction LARPing, of Second-life and, if Zuck has his way, of Meta. Reality dismediated from physical place. The internet can be an escape for folks and the challenges they face in the real world; that can be a healthy and helpful thing. When we lose ourselves completely in escapism; that tends to not be healthy for an individual and it certainly limits their ability to build relationship to place and orient towards bioregionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Narrow Optimisers&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our global trade networks and contemporary corporate/private bureaucracies are filled with narrow optimisiers; those squeezing ‘efficiency’ or ‘performance’ in their specific realm, without regard for overall systemic health or the health of things connected to them (and they are often rewarded and incentivised to do this). This impulse has hidden costs/risks; shipping peaches halfway around the globe where it is cheapest to have them canned, and then shipping them back for sale, because it’s ‘cheaper’ to do so, despite the transportation costs (which rarely have their environmental impact factored into their cost). Buying unverifiable carbon credits for afforestation projects in a distant country, instead of changing industrial processes to reduce their carbon footprint, because it’s ‘cheaper’. Running large-scale sustainability analyses while treating one acre of pastureland as completely interchangeable with one acre of floodplain cropland. Narrow optimizers tend to paper over or reduce the nuance and complexities of our ecologies and interconnectedness; so it might take time for them to value what bioregionalism has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Living in the Past&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nostalgia is a powerful force. There are plenty of folks distracted by longings for real or imagined ideas of ‘how things were’, to the extent that they will not engage with other orientations like bioregionalism. Of course, it is entirely possible for forms of nostalgia to exist inside the bioregional community as well. We can imagine an alluring past, where humans were living in harmony with the lands, and imbue that vision with facets that aren’t entirely true or reflective of what was (perhaps we pretend that there was no hunger, disease or conflict… or we become enamoured with the trope of the “Noble Savage”). Like with almost all the orientations I am touching on, there are ideas and inspirations that we can draw on when bringing a new world into life (via bioregionalism or otherwise). Again, the need is that we don’t get lost or stuck in an orientation that is always looking backward, and not doing so truthfully. Folks looking back to 1950s America or the good ole days of the USSR will struggle to get on board with what bioregionalism has to offer (and both of these nostalgia traps are a yearning to return to the simplicity of modernity’s peak).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Ad Astra, ‘To the stars’&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another niche of folks that would struggle with the need in bioregionalism to be grounded in place, are those whose hearts and eyes are turned to the stars. They look so far ahead, I fear they neglect where they stand today (and will continue to stand for decades/centuries). I loved Kim Stanley-Robinson’s Mars trilogies as a teen; the colonisation of Mars and all the human complexities of that. Imagine, to be a part of the fabled “First Hundred” humans to spread civilization beyond our home, what an adventure! And as the years go by, the more I notice Stanley-Robinson’s subtle depiction of earth from these books; climate-strained, dysfunctional, broken. I fear that too many in the ‘Ad Astra’ crowd either gloss-over, or do not care enough about the problems we face here on earth, in stewarding our home. In recent years, I have also become increasingly of the view that the hardest space travel problems are not the big engineering complexities of moving matter over incredible distances but instead the subtle fractal complexity of keeping our bodies functioning outside of our biosphere for any long-term duration. And thus, we can’t just&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These different orientations likely require different strategies for getting folks onboard with bioregionalism. How soon will it be that ChatGPT-clones are trained to deeply understand an orientation like bioregionalism, and conflicting or competing orientations, and then be able to probe, question and query someone to understand their particular blockages towards an orientation and directly address those?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of reading a blog post or listening to a podcast about a subject, targeted at a broad audience, we can have an interactive chat with a bot that can push us straight to the crux of whether we align with something or not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And how do we trust that these bots won’t lead us down a path to confusion (because they are flat out factually wrong, which ChatGPT is in repeatable ways) or bias us in a certain direction (Someone chatting with the ‘Bioregionalism-persuader bot’ has assumably given consent but how do we trust the ‘educational history chatbot’ our school district has just introduced from another Silicon Valley startup?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;And now for something completely different&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last few questions I asked ChatGPT about Bioregionalism were a bit silly…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Write me a synopsis for a movie about two bioregions figuring out who is responsible for someone building a small dam in the watershed that both bioregions share&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Dam Mystery” is a film about two bioregions that share a watershed and must work together to solve a mystery surrounding a small dam that has been built in their shared water source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film begins with the discovery of the dam, which has caused confusion and concern among the residents of both bioregions. Both sides suspect the other of building the dam, and tensions begin to rise as each side becomes more convinced that the other is responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the investigation into the dam’s origins begins, the leaders of both bioregions are forced to work together and overcome their differences in order to find the truth. They encounter a number of challenges along the way, including conflicting accounts of the dam’s construction, lack of evidence, and hostile reactions from some members of their respective communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these obstacles, the leaders of the bioregions remain determined to find out who is responsible for the dam. They eventually uncover a plot by a group of outsiders who had built the dam in order to disrupt the water supply and create chaos between the two bioregions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the leaders of the bioregions are able to expose the true perpetrators and bring them to justice, and they are able to rebuild the damaged relationships between their communities. The film ends with the two bioregions working together to restore the watershed and to prevent future conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty cliched but could we spice it up a little bit?&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Could you add another plot twist to “The Dam Mystery”?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, here is a potential additional plot twist for “The Dam Mystery”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the leaders of the two bioregions continue their investigation into the dam’s origins, they begin to uncover evidence that suggests that the dam was not built by outsiders as they had originally suspected. Instead, they discover that the dam was actually built by a group of rogue scientists who were working on a secret project to manipulate the water supply in order to test a new type of water purification technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists had hoped to secretly test their technology and then present it as a solution to the water supply problem once it was discovered. However, their plan backfired when the dam was discovered earlier than they had expected, and they were forced to go into hiding in order to avoid being caught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaders of the bioregions are shocked by this revelation, and they must decide how to handle the situation. Do they expose the scientists and risk causing a panic, or do they keep the secret and allow the scientists to continue their work in the hope that it will lead to a solution to the water supply problem? The leaders are faced with a difficult decision, and they must weigh the potential risks and benefits of each option before ultimately making a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well that settles it then, I better get working on my great bioregional propaganda movie, “The Dam Mystery”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;than with this post!).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After out-lining challenges to mapping bioregions in part 3 of this little sequence on bioregionalism, it is time for me to make a coherent pitch for how I think we should address them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the prior post, I did suggest I had an idea for an uncommon scheme for tracking bioregions. The geometric basis of that scheme is the H3 grid system. The grid system has 15 ‘resolution’ levels, defining the size of the cells that tile the surface of the earth (level 0 has the biggest cells, level 15 the smallest cells). These cells are functionally all hexagons. To define bioregions we would pick a resolution around 10-12, and use those hexagon cells as the building blocks that make up the region. Each cell has a unique address, or index. This allows us to define regions and areas using a list of indexes, instead of coordinate values. Using H3 indexes instead of coordinate values reduces the amount of data we have to send to low-bandwidth clients or space constrained storages such as blockchains or web3 applications. All information or data we want to emphasise for our bioregions can be collated against these cells, using the index. This data can be used to help us define the boundaries of regions, and to rapidly build up statistical comparisons between different versions of the same bioregion or neighbouring bioregions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An example of a hexagon grid on a map&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This base geometry gives us our building blocks but there are still many ways we can put those pieces together. To that end, we need a few other aspects of the overall system, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A process to define a bioregion, and probably some tooling to help folks do that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A question answered, about whether we should put together a region hierarchy (like the parcel-county-state normie hierarchy in the USA) for bioregions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A ratification process, where folks proposing a specific bioregion can be recognised by others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A deconfliction process, where neighbouring bioregions can determine ecological stewardship for ecologies they share, or otherwise deconflict different bioregional narratives for the same areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A communal register for tracking all of this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of these processes are deeply communal and would be aided by user-friendly tooling. Some of these processes could be built directly into Hylo and have important artefacts published to distributed ledgers, for open access and record-keeping. I will touch on each of these facets of a mapping scheme and then finish up with some of the possibilities unlocked by their use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How will we determine bioregions from these cells then?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this underlying hexagon layer, we can define areas of whatever scale that is desired&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be a total free for all; people could elect to have continent wide bioregions, or perhaps even a tiny bioregion defined by a single stretch of a river. This might put additional strain on whatever deconfliction mechanism that comes to be. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alternatively, we could formulate a couple of layers in a regional hierarchy. For example, we could define three-scale set of regions, from smaller to larger; a ‘home’ area for each person, a local watershed area and then a full bioregion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another option would be having several different bioregional coordination layers; one for your watershed, for water and soil health; one for key-stone species, like the Salmon Nation bioregion; one for adjacent areas with the same climate, for working on biodiversity and shared food systems; and one cultural or population center focused. This would require a high level of comfort with the organising concepts of bioreigonalism, so might not be the first option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How might we propose and ratify a bioregion?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I certainly would not be in charge of ratification ;) This would need to be an emergent communal process. The process would need to be driven by as many contemporary bioregionalists as we can muster. That initial buy-in can build adoption and we must also anticipate that growth of the movement will bring in new people and new ideas, that will also need to be integrated into any concept of ratification. One of the visions for Hylo is the development of a ‘trust graph’, which is a mechanism for different organisations and folks to denote their trust in each other. Something like this could essentially function as a ratification process, where different bioregional groups recognise each other in a mutually reinforcing process. There are a lot of different ways this could be achieved, and I will leave further discussion and detailing of this to a time further down this collective path.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How might we handle deconfliction?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deconfliction would need to happen at a range of levels; day-to-day, for each intervention or proposal, and at the meta-bioregional level. An example at each level: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A hiker missing in a canyon along the borders of two bioregions; how do the two bioregions quickly figure out how to search for them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A wetlands restoration intervention is proposed, that impacts a whole watershed (potentially impacting a range of bioregions); Who is impacted by this, who will do the work, who needs to be involved in the decisions of the intervention?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bioregionalism is taking off; three different and partially overlapping bioregions are proposed in a south-west American state; How do we navigate this? Does someone living in an area with overlap split their voting power proportionally between the different regions? Is there a political process whereby responsibility for an area is approportioned to one bioregion, as determined by those who live in that area?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processes and structure around these deconfliction levels will need to evolve with the scale (number of people and lands) at which we are operating at. There is little to be gained from over-structuring these processes as the movement grows. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt;… it would be handy to have some ideas about how to do it at a meta-bioregional level for this mapping scheme to make progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of this, we need to find a way to integrate a bioregion’s changing constituency as time goes by; One cannot set the agenda and focus for a bioregion just because one was the first to organise in this way in a bioregion. For example, two bioregions might agree on a border and then years later the residents of that specific area might become more bioregionally aware and disagree with how that border or edge has been draw or is managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Side-note on edges: In ecological systems, we find that edges hold a special role. The edges of different ecological and/or climatic systems tend to be important places of additional biological diversity, flourishing and vitality. Human-centric regions tend to focus on the center; a big city, town or gathering confluence in an area. And do so for understandable reasons. By inviting a more ecological way of relating to our regions, we ask ourselves to pay attention to these important edge spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This edge effect happens at many scales in ecological systems, whether it is the edge of a huge mountain range, or the edge of the water on a simple creek. So, the edge of a bioregion isn’t necessarily what I am seeking to emphasise here. However, there might be critical ecological confluences, at the edges of different bioregions, that do play an important ecological role for each of the systems that border these confluences. In these instances, it might make sense to convene a specific long-standing jointly managed sub-region that allows each of those neighbouring bioregions to have rights and responsibilities to that special ‘edge’ zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A communal register&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I am helping to build Hylo, it is fairly convenient for a communal register for bioregions to be built into it ;) . Having it &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; accessible via Hylo is not likely to be the best outcome for adoption of the mapping scheme and the growth of the bioregional movement. There are a couple of main options for hosting the register:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Host on Hylo, with accessible API&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separate public API, with Hylo just one client of the separate service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some (all?) of the process integrated into some sort of distributed ledger/blockchain/web3 thing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all forms of digitalised record keeping. If widely adopted, the mapping scheme would also need to have non-digital processes to fall back on, for greater resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding how to handle this register involves matters touched on in several sections of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/bioregional/bioregion-3/&quot;&gt;part 3 of this series&lt;/a&gt;, including ‘How ought it be shared?’, ‘What process do we use?’ and ‘Do we have the skillsets, resources…’, so I won’t repeat that here. I will briefly note that for Hylo (as a bioregionally focused platform), hosting the register would be totally within our emergent vision space, and I can also see it being handy to have key data artefacts of the process (initial proposal for a bioregion, the outcome of a ratification process, etc) be published to a distributed immutable ledger, as a public record of these key events. And, as I have mentioned previously, practically speaking, any such register or bioregional mapping effort we undertake with Hylo/Terran Collective will need to be prioritised and funded in some way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What could be built on top of this mapping scheme?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some possibilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A proposal/intervention process where the say in decision-making is proportional to the impact on a person or group of people. The use of the hexagon grid allows for rapid and clear accounting of impact and apportioning influence (in a numerical voting system).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common geographical ‘grammar’ for displaying data that impacts the ecological well-being of a bioregion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This includes being able to readily map ‘flows’ between hexagons; each edge of a hexagon can be used to map a relationship between neighbours; for example, the flow rate of water through a watershed. Or the general ease of transit between neighbouring hexagons, allowing quick understanding of why communities pool towards certain population centers versus others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow us to define and build-in consideration for how we handle ‘edges’; blending ecological responsibilities between neighbouring bioregions across the hexagon cells either side of their boundary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Different concepts for bioregions in an area to co-exist while deconfliction and finding resonance takes place. While bioregions won’t be ‘imagined communities’ to the same extent as nation-states, they will still need to have an identity pulled out of their histories and ecological characteristics. A region could have several competing ideas or narratives for what ought to define its bioregional identity and we can only really sort through deconfliction of that over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To revisit part of the context here: I am not aiming at the mapping-scheme scale of ‘tidy polygon layer for my pretty map’ but instead aiming at ‘the logistical and administrative replacement of state, county and electoral-district boundaries’. I am driving towards that end because I want a mapping scheme that can facilitate and underpin that replacement, as the opportunities to grow systems of coordination arise. We rarely consider the benign in-efficiencies (gaps in coordination because of county boundaries) or malign influences (gerrymandering) that come from the our existing boundaries but this concern is a facet for bioregions existence; breaking free of arbitrary lines on the earth, that our ecologies and watersheds have little or no relationship to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not driving towards creating a nice map layer at all. Instead, I seek a more ‘honest’ mapping of bioregions. Yes, when we yearn for a map of bioregions, we imagine a defined set of geometries that we can lovingly display and offer in a drop-down list. But to adopt that as a primary outcome is to imply that we know too much; we know better how to define a bioregional or ecological ‘home’ or region than the folks who live there, even if we are empowered with great ecological knowledge of that region. I think it can be our place to propose or suggest possible bioregions. And, I would prefer to do that guesswork after the key-work is done; creating a lattice or structure into which others can inject their understandings of their own bioregion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a tradeoff; Choosing the messy process of gradually building up a set of ‘ratified’ bioregions is more honest, versus generating an aesthetic set of predefined regions that is easier to ‘market’ bioregionalism with (note: marketing bioregionalism is an important goal as well!). There will be a yearning for a legible set of bioregions straight off the bat. And while we can fulfil that yearning by making up yet-another-set of bioregions, I don’t think that process will create a space for the existing bioregional-adjacent communities around the world to get on board with bioregionalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes my bioregional series for 2022. I hope it can spark some discussions within our team and across our stakeholders, for exploring how we might tackle the mapping of bioregions. Based on how those conversations go, we will be able to start answering this question of what can come next, out of all of this.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The challenges of mapping bioregions (Part 3)]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the third post in a three part series on bioregions.

&lt;p&gt;We want to start mapping out bioregions. We have realised there are lots of fiddly questions and nuance that come from that. We are going to try sort through all that anyway. This is a bit more of a nitty-gritty, and possibly wonky read, so please set your expectations accordingly (and if you are trying to share with someone about bioregionalism, I wouldn’t start with this post!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What process can we use to determine bioregions in the mapping context?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the key things we need to consider in a process for mapping something? In all cases, we tend to consider questions including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How ought it be represented via geometry?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What data can we map to the base geometry and can we get it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And following on from those questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How ought it be shared?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we have the skill-sets, resources, access and time to achieve the scheme that is the outcome of answering these questions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What sort of process do we use to take all of the above geometries, data and inputs to actually generate bioregions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How might these choices help or hinder other processes layered on top of this system (voting systems)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For bioregions, as understood by bioregionalists, we also consider the human cultural aspect&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we create bioregions that resonate with folks that live in that region?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions or considerations also form an interlocking bundle; its very hard to consider them one at a time, figure out that piece out in isolation, and then move on to the next question. If we attempt to solve for only one question at a time, it can defacto lock us into only a narrow range of options for other considerations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, a mapping scheme is just an exercise in imagination unless it is adopted by folks. Figuring out who are the various adoptees, users and champions of a mapping scheme, and when to involve them, is very much the meta-art of building a mapping scheme. This post is very much a result of trying to address that process, and if you’ve read this far, odds are you are one of those potential stakeholders!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is going to be a living journal of all of my research and thinking about all these different considerations. As of 30 May 2022 (and prior), I have had an idea for an uncommon scheme to achieve the goal of mapping bioregions, but I want to lay out the alternative concepts and justify the trade-offs inherent in any of the design choices one must make in these matters. Wish me (and us) luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How ought it be represented via geometry?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation&quot;&gt;“The map is not the territory”&lt;/a&gt; is a relatively well-known philosophical phrase that denotes that the representations and models we make about reality are not reality themselves, despite their benefit in allowing us to share understandings of reality. The geometry is the literal representation of territory; the sort of geometry we use to represent something will shape how we think about that something. And, may I remind us always, the representation is always a reduction of what it represents; and thus, it is ‘always wrong’ in some sense. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong&quot;&gt;All representations (models) are wrong, some are useful.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that prelude, how do different options shape up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Unique polygons&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unique in the sense that each bioregion has its own custom geometry, not dependent on a known set of geometries (like parcels or county boundaries). This, for one bioregion, is very straight-forward and familiar. When we are creating a series of bioregions though, the flexibility of unique polygons adds complexity fast. We have to enforce topologically sensible boundaries; random little gaps or overlaps between bioregions can lead to confusion in some instances. A second consideration is that creating custom polygons for a large number of bioregions can be a lot of work, and we cannot easily crowd-source that because of the topological concerns. Mapping data from other sources into these custom polygons is also a little more onerous than other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;‘Known’ polygons&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing polygon systems include: counties, shires, parcels, watershed systems, zipcodes, WWFs ecozones and many more. These aren’t generally appropriate for a direct mapping of one bioregion to one of these geometries but if the geometries are small enough, they could be used as constituent pieces of a bioregion (for example, these five counties together make up a bioregion). One advantage is that data and information that we want to use to make sense of a bioregion may already be encoded into these polygon systems. However, almost all of these know polygon systems will be constrained by country and state/province boundaries, which gets in the way of the ecological aspect of mapping a bioregion. And some of these systems (zipcodes, parcel data, etc) will be clear and comprehensive for one part of the world but not whole continents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Grid systems&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grid systems in mapping tend to grapple with the challenge of applying a globally coherent set of pre-defined shapes to the earth, as a way to streamline the organization of data. They make all sorts of data comparisons and sorting easier, once the data has been mapped to the grid system. The two global grid systems I am familiar are S2 and H3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://s2geometry.io/&quot;&gt;S2&lt;/a&gt; was made by google and divides the world up into a hierarchical scheme of four-sided polygons that interlock over the whole world. Its great as a spatial index, meaning a way to quickly ‘address’ datasets that have geometries. It is not very appealing as a representation geometry; the four sided shapes distort in appearance, dependent on their location on the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H3 came out of Uber, helping them track supply and demand for rides. In addition to the advantages of S2, it also provides a better representation geometry with its hexagon grid, along with more consistent relational dynamics between the grid elements. That consistency in relational dynamics makes it simpler to derive impact across the hexagons in a local area. Say if we wanted to apportion voting power by distance from an intervention, that would be very simple to calculate with this grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Point data&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This option is more of a thought-experiment than a practical choice. If we represented a bioregion as a point at its notional center, we would do away with the issue of defining boundaries… because there would be no boundaries to define! Figuring out where that center is, membership and identity for these would be a constant nightmare, as would trying to represent data in this scheme. I would prefer to pass on this option.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What data can we map to the base geometry and can we get it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be incredible to inform our decisions about defining bioregions by having access to keystone species, habitat boundaries, watersheds, human patterns of movement and land-use, local inhabitants perspectives, ecological and climatic factors, etc etc… And each of these possible data sources would need to be 1) Found or created (!) 2) Ported to whatever geometry we settle on 3) analysed and integrated into whatever process is used to delineate bioregions 4) Updated as things inevitably change over time. On top of all that, the different datasets would ideally be global, or at least harmonised across global datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, going for both breadth and depth on all of these feels like a mind-boggling amount of work. With an infinite budget, it would probably still take a lot of human talent and time to get everything our hearts could desire. Consequently, some level of prioritisation of data-sets and a periodic, iterative process of determining bioregions will serve us best, as we add more data and community input over time. For now, I will detail initial views and guesses on what data sets we could use and how easy (or hard) it will be to integrate it into a process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Human population density &amp;#x26; Human landscape management density&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population density is fairly easy to get as a data source, and while I would not factor it in bioregion boundaries, it is useful as a quick indicator of our impact in an ecology. It ought to be paired with datasets related to human landscape management; the distribution of our built environment (‘towns and pastures’ versus ‘suburbs and motorways’ could have the same human density but very different ecological impacts), distribution of agriculture, infrastructure and ‘managed’ landscapes. Getting all the different datasets that could inform human landscape management will vary in ease (especially across the globe) but are really handy for giving folks a read on what bioregional interventions might be transferable between different regions. These datasets will also be handy for tracking bioregional health over time, as we create different distributions of human impact on ecologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Watersheds&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watersheds should be fairly easy to source data-sets for, perhaps a little annoying to make consistent across the globe, and are key for determining impact in some categories of bioregional intervention (removal of a dam, waste water treatment, etc). Watersheds will have an impact on bioregional boundaries but it is a bit fuzzy to determine the cut-off vs continuation point for them. For example, the whole Mississippi basin crosses vast terrains and contains a diverse range of ecologies and peoples; It would be an unwieldly bioregion to coordinate for all matters. Better to have smaller bioregions that are more nimble, but that have an inter-bioregional coordination mechanism for watershed scale interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Ease of movement&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Ease of movement’, stemming from a military term I’m familiar with, ‘lines of communication’, is important for bioregions because the easier it is for humans, materials and flora and fauna to move through different areas, the more likely those areas make sense as being connected into a bioregion. Generating this dataset might be a little cumbersome, built up from how easy terrain is to traverse (open plains vs thick jungle), infrastructure like roads and railways (etc), and even human defined borders (this is where I’d prefer borders to influence bioregions for now). This could be extended to be split into human and fauna categories; a system of highways might make it easier for humans to get around but cut off access to different regions for animals. Not the highest priority dataset to compile but one that I think does significantly impact how ecosystems function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Climatic factors (marine influence, latitude, elevation, weather patterns)&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climatic factors deeply shape ecologies. The flora and fauna of a bioregion are ultimately all consequences of the climatic conditions of a place. Datasets that represent climatic conditions are typically very available, the tricky aspect will stem from how they are combined to understand bioregional boundaries. The Köppen climate classification system could represent an easy initial drop-in analysis to cover that ‘tricky’ integration question, as it provides a concise characterisation of the climatic conditions apparent in different places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Flora and fauna habitation patterns&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flora and fauna of a region can be the most obvious identifying features of an area. From a long term local perspective of an area, there are usually one or two dozen trees, animals, plants, etc that define a region. From the outside perspective, it might be tricky to determine what are the key flora and flora, and also how that influences the boundaries of a bioregion. &lt;em&gt;Coppice Agroforesty&lt;/em&gt; notes that the Society of American Foresters identified 145 different ‘natural communities’ of forest stands, using names of one to three dominant species like “Hemlock-Sitka Spruce” or “Oak-Hickory”. That might be a good dataset for this purpose but would need to be complimented by similar datasets for other regions of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Minimum viable data set?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the least amount of work and data we can get away with while still providing a decent basis for the creation of bioregions? This is my current working set, as of November 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human population density&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Koppen climate classification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built environment (proxy for human landscape management)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Agricultural lands (proxy for human landscape management)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watersheds (depending on how easily their representation can be harmonised across continents)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue hammering home the point, these would of course need to be integrated into some process to actually generate bioregions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How ought it be shared?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever mapping scheme we come up with, it has to be shared in order to serve any purpose. Ideally it would be open and free for non-commercial uses, and user and developer-friendly, to aid in adoption. As of November 2022, I am just going to note what else needs to be considered around getting a mapping scheme into use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Versioning/Publishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editing/Updating (particularly as new data or new community inputs become available)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution; Making it available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of uncollected thoughts about these topics but I think any deeper delving into them can wait for another time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What process do we use?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What sort of process do we use to take all of the above geometries, data and inputs to actually generate bioregions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much of the process can be automated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can we factor in community input?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a role for ‘expert’ stewardship/input?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do we handle different communities/stakeholders having different ideas about bioregion boundaries?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly to the “How ought it be shared” question, there are many many tangents and factors that could be delved into for this question set as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What other systems and/or uses might be layered on top of a bioregional mapping scheme?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might these choices help or hinder other processes layered on top of this system? In a future where bioregionalism grows, do we want the mapping of those bioregions to remain just a geographic ‘vibe’ for a region, or do we want the mapping scheme to help underpin our coordination at a deeper level? If we take the ‘vibe’ route, a bioregional boundary will be useful as a banner to rally folks together and little more. If we invest more effort and thought into answering the prickly questions about how to define a bioregional mapping system, then we can build a foundation of a deeper coordination system. A deeper mapping scheme can underpin how we identify who is impacted by a possible decision or intervention and a possible estimation for how much someone is impacted. In essence, a deeper mapping scheme is needed if we want bioregional governance to scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of the complexity and contention around the geography of the USA political system; allocation of senators via state-boundaries. Gerrymandering of districts to consolidate one party’s political power. The rural/urban schism papered over by ‘blue’ or ‘red’ states. The geographies of all of the states, counties and districts in the USA electoral system are the water in which USA politics swims in. If there are any aspirations to one day surpass this fractious system, we will need a ‘better’ mapping scheme for our coordination to swim in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do we have the skill-sets, resources, access and time to achieve the scheme that is the outcome of answering these questions?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew, this is a tough one. Do we even have enough bandwidth to define the problem space, let alone any solutions!? (I’ve been pecking away at the problem space, here and there for most of 2022 now). We would need to go through a prolonged ‘gathering-support -&gt; building -&gt; validation -&gt; gathering support’ cycle to drive this, and over time we would need to keep coming back to this question.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do we create bioregions that resonate with folks that live in that region?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, we peel this question in two; those that get what a bioregion is and those that don’t. And a particularly salient parallel question in reflection is: Does building a mapping scheme mean 1) generating a set of bioregions to proffer to people, or 2) generating a framework or structure on to which folks can bring their concepts of bioregions into a shared system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;If you already know what a bioregion is&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, you probably already have solid ideas of what your bioregion is, and maybe ideas about some neighbouring bioregions. The challenge faced here is how do we harmonise your ideas of your bioregion with someone that lives down the street? Yes, of course, talk about it with them, but what do we do when we have different ideas of the scale, extent and defining characteristics of a bioregion? Here, a proffered set of bioregions will tend to feel constrictive to existing bioregionalists. Having a framework, with some process, by which existing bioregionalists can iron out the above differences in scale, extent, etc, for their bioregion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;If you don’t have a clue about bioreigonalism&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, in this case, proffering a set of bioregions, with some explanation about their formulative logic, would likely spur adoption and interest in bioregionalism. It would allow someone new to the concept of bioregionalism to grasp a tangible local example and wrestle with it straight from the start. Essentially, it would avoid the dead-end to the understandable question of “Well, bioregionalism sounds interesting, what’s my bioregion then?” (The dead-end here is asking someone to figure it out for themselves).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a tension worth emphasising here, between the supposed needs of the in-group and the out-group. Build only for the in-group; create something that helps with coordination but not necessarily growth of the movement. Build only for the out-group, and struggle to rally the existing bioregionalists to adopt the mapping scheme. Clearly any scheme which hopes for success will build for both, and will need to have the right mix of features/trade-offs to bring both groups into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Resonance, bioregions and ‘Home’&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other important aspect of making bioregions that resonate with folks is whether a pitched bioregion can feel like ‘Home’ to those who live there. Or maybe more broadly, does it create a sense of belonging? Nation-states are ‘imagined communities’; they are a shared narrative about a collection of places and peoples. When they don’t resonate, when they are too contrived, when they fail to live up to their myths and promises, these stories tear at the fabric of society, instead of generating cohesion. Bioregionalism is in part a call to reevaluate and reemphasise our relationship to the lands, creatures, living environment, traditions, peoples, and sacred places that we live amongst and in. That reevaluation and reemphasising will be constrained if folks cannot generate a sense of belonging to place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What next?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No doubt, there is more nuance, more detail, in all of the above. And after this sort of survey of the challenge space, there ought to come synthesis and distillation. I need to make a pitch. I need to flesh this out with a story of what might be, and how we might get there.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[BRC Camp Contact 2022; Reflections]]></title><description><![CDATA[2022 was probably the harshest build and strike weeks Camp Contact has experienced at BRC.

I write to document elements of that experience, to analyze what I saw as the key difficulties that lead to this being the hardest build, and to go a little deeper into the camp responsibility that I am calling Reception (Arrival, off-load, parking, tent placement, RV placement and orientation). Before the burn, I was trying to line up being the orientation lead. Thus a bunch of my experience is shaped by this. I will also talk to the four major phases of a large theme camp being out at BRC; Build, Finishing, Burn and Strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Report style:&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will attempt to echo the report writing style from my intel report writing days; observations and ‘factual’ (as far as we can be) details, separated from my comments/opinions/analysis (either in italics in-line or in a separate paragraph), sandwiched on both ends by key findings/summaries. &lt;em&gt;Comment from later in the writing: this writing style peetered out somewhat, because, spoiler alert, I left halfway through the writing of it to briefly return to the playa to help with strike.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Key Difficulties&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strongest winds in BRC living memory during build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent and long white-outs for most of build, some of the burn and a lot of strike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First BRC after three years for the camp; we were rusty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate knowledge degraded or missing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anahasa Village in center plot, not corner plot; knocked out of our regular setup and defacto rhythm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expectations across the camp about what we are being ‘asked to do’ from a regular build week did not reflect reality. This build and strike asked much more of us than normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year was hard for large camps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We still made it happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the challenging external circumstances of this burn, there are plenty of ways we can do things better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camp Contact is facing an inflection point: restructure/change or collapse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am naming the orientation/parking/placement nexus as Reception, and will define roles within that area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will tell you about how some tents make me sad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inshallah future build weeks don’t have winds like this for a while&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;A Rough Timeline&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buckle up…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15-20 August:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various peeps start road trips to Reno in prep for build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, 21 August:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Team gathers in Reno&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bangkok cuisine is no longer open on Sunday evening. &lt;em&gt;Comment: Maybe the first bad omen. Sunday dinner at Bangkok Thai is a long time build team tradition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial team camps at Pyramid Lake Sunday night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, 22 August:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial build team rolls into BRC. Build commences after placement.  &lt;em&gt;Comment: I was not there for this part of the trip, so I am unaware of any notable events during this time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, 23 August:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build continues at BRC Camp Contact. Word goes out that the camp needs more fresh water. &lt;em&gt;Comment: not sure if this means we are just rusty and didn’t individually bring enough to be radically self-reliant or if our fresh water infrastructure or delivery was delayed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back in Grass Valley, after weeks of trying to get prior camp contact orientation material in my possession, I finally got through to the person who had that material (Their slack notifications were off :) ). They are already on playa, in our village but with another camp. I edit the orientation walk-through script and print off some copies as part of our final prep and pack. &lt;em&gt;Comment: Camp knowledge relies on either the same people coming back year after year or someone remembering who did a job in prior years and connecting that person to the new person in the role. Emergent (aka lower initial complexity) but risky (incurs risk of greater complexity downstream).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After lunch, Heart House crew sets out from Grass Valley and arrives at BRC around sun-down. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of that Tuesday evening, there is a push to get the Himalayas sorted to the extent that the build crew can setup tents. &lt;em&gt;Comment: I heard that some key structures were a little behind by Tuesday afternoon/evening; namely the Himalayas, our main dormitory shade shelter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tents are popped up fairly ad-hoc under the shelter and folks tuck in after a long night&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday, 24 August:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wednesday morning, approximately 3am: The build team are woken by howling winds, large bangs and crashes. For about 15-20 minutes, incredibly fierce gusts continued to batter our area of BRC. &lt;em&gt;Comment: later I heard these gusts were estimated at up to 70 miles per hour.&lt;/em&gt; After the wind subsided a little, the build crew spent about an hour assessing immediate damage and otherwise securing the structures as best we could. It was apparent that several of the shade structure support poles had punctured several of the four fabric shelter panels that made up the roof of the Himalayas, and one of the wind-side walls of the structure had completely ripped away from the shark-bites that were securing the wall to the ground. &lt;em&gt;Comment: This sharkbite wall was probably one of our weakest walls, and in hindsight, should not have been placed on the prevailing wind side of the structure&lt;/em&gt;. The Himalayas were partially collapsed and several roof panels were sagging on to the build crew’s tents.  At around 430am, most of the build crew returned to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After day-break, I walk around and send out this Himalayas damage report. &lt;em&gt;Comment: large hole is over a foot by a foot&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Roof panel one; two large holes, one small. Roof panel two; three large holes, one small. Roof panel three; one medium hole. Roof panel four; undamaged. One wall panel out of action; all sharkbites torn-off” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comment: later the designer of our shade structure Eric, noted that the sharkbites that had been used were below the initial spec of what was designed for&lt;/em&gt;. The roof panels maintain the overall structural integrity of the Himalayas by being held taunt against the tops of the shade structure support poles. These poles spread the force of the taunt fabric against them over a four petal ‘flower’. If the petals of the flower collapse, the force of the fabric against the top of the pole will punch a hole in the fabric.  &lt;em&gt;Comment: We speculate that with the break of the weak-wall, the gusts could get under the shade structure. Each gust would then pop the fabric off the roof support poles, freeing the petals of each flower briefly. Since the tension of the roof fabric was no longer holding the petals in place, they started to collapse, there-after leading to the support poles puncturing through the roof in several places&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Separately, the other significant structural damage in camp is to the kitchen. It is built using EMT conduit. &lt;em&gt;Comment: primarily EMT is used to route electrical cables around built-environments but is commonly used as a structural kit for more ad-hoc structures&lt;/em&gt;.  Maybe 30% of the EMT poles used for the kitchen have been bent beyond use/repair. Poles and parts were scavenged from other structures while we arranged for replacements to come in via Reno.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over the progress of the day, while we scramble to understand how we might even go about repairing the Himalayas, further holes are created by the roof panels rubbing against tent tops.  &lt;em&gt;Comment: we were arguably 36-48 hours behind schedule at this point, with an already overworked team, and still constant concerns about more winds forecasted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We got in touch with Eric (Epic), the designer of the Himalayas. Learnt about how to strengthen the flowers on the support poles and a team set about getting the parts for that and making the changes, while others begun stitching the many holes back together with fishing line. &lt;em&gt;Comment: even later I would hear from Eric that the reinforced flower design was actually the original design but that in the first year (2017? 2018?) the right parts weren’t ordered. Between that, and using the weak-wall on the wind-side, we probably wouldn’t have suffered such damage, even with the rare strong winds&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The shade structure being down meant we also couldn’t progress in laying down the tarps that are used as flooring for the Himalayas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, more and more camp members were arriving on playa, and the temporary placement of a bunch of tents (including my own) was getting decidedly dodgy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday, 25 August:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Himalayas are finally fully operational and the long over-due placement reckoning (when we actually start to finally place tents in their ‘permanent’ spot) can begin. Matters quickly come to ahead, as several of the build-team are already exhausted, haven’t been able to fully settle into their space and unpack, and now have the spectre of having to move their tents hanging over their heads. &lt;em&gt;Comment: perhaps needless to say, but the longer it takes for this initial placement reckoning to happen, the more reshuffling risk we take on as a camp. Given the damage to the Himalayas, this happened much later in the build week than desireable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday, 26 August:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build continues at a frantic pace; There is certainly some tension in camp about how to distribute our work and rest cycles; whether to get cracking early in the morning, in the lower temperatures and siesta in the afternoons before another work sesh in the cooler evening temps. This is complicated by several late-night unexpected work sessions (yes, the initial winds on Tuesday night but also food deliveries coming in at difficult hours), the general angst of being behind (and thus pushing pushing pushing constantly), uncertainly about how to integrate proper rest into our work cycles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Into the ‘Finishing’ phase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe there is a better name for this phase but there is normally a distinct phase shift between the heavy-lifting ‘build’ part of the week and the ‘finishing up’ part of build week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, 27 August:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t have much of a distinct recall of this day. More and more folks were arriving and generally doing their best to get amongst it. One organizational challenge is that despite having plenty of fresh camp mates arriving, they didn’t have the knowledge to just pick up tasks or complete structures. Thus, we still relied heavily on folks who were already pushed to the limit, for direction and guidance about how to achieve various goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a prior year, I had joined build week on Thursday, when the camp was already in the ‘finishing’ phase. In the ‘finishing’ phase, all structures are more or less up, and we are focusing on flooring, decor, sparkle, build-clean-up and otherwise prepping to receive all of our camp mates and guests. This year, build bled heavily into this ‘finishing’ phase, particularly as various structures had been reassigned to other priority uses. The ‘reception’ part of camp responsibilities crescendos during this ‘finishing’ phase because that is when the most people arrive. We had over 100 campers already here by Saturday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From the overall Reception perspective pre-burn, we had a orientation lead, and an RV placement lead. We didn’t have anyone dedicated on tent placement &lt;em&gt;Comment: In a year where we are taking on the most campers ever (215 peeps vs 170), and not necessarily more shade space&lt;/em&gt;. And we did not have anyone dedicated to parking. I absorbed placement and parking, focused as the solo person on placement (it was hard to delegate due to the constraints of the task), then delegated as much orientation stuff as I could (from Thursday through Tuesday) and delegated parking on Sunday when that was depth-charged by changes to the village parking scheme. Praise be to Wolf, Salix and Makenna for stepping up here! My mental, physical and spiritual saviors &amp;#x3C;3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Commentary: Reception is all about optimizing the flow of camp folks arriving at BRC, and know what to do when they arrive at camp. Camp Contact, for maybe at least a decade, but probably more, has been on an intersection, on a corner lot.  Not only does that make it easier to find but provides more obvious places for folks to park. I do believe our change in placement caused some confusion for folks arriving. We directed folks to aim for the chill dome at 638 &amp;#x26; E, but didn’t have a sign up for most of the week, denoting that the corner there was camp contact. The aussie contingent parked next to the chill dome became defacto greeters, and in general that area had too little space to act even as a temp staging spot before people got their full parking placement. Multiple times folks were parked in and we had to chase folks around camp to figure out who was stuck there. Given the loss of the natural advantages here with a corner lot, our whole village probably needs to address this need with some fore-thought, layout tweaks, planning, better comms and new signage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunday, 28 August:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On a personal note, my Sunday started at about 1am when a kindly individual from a neighboring village rolled up about 20 meters from my tent, opened all their doors, jacked up their car sound system and promptly blasted tunes until about 3am when the unattended car’s keys miraculously fell out of the vehicles ignition. Sunday was also the birthday of a member of my family-in-love, who was no longer with us. Thus begun what was nominally the busiest day of responsibilities for someone involved in Reception (aka myself).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most significant shenanigans of that day was finding out about the reorganization of the ‘village’ parking at about 11am in the morning. I was shown a new hardcopy map, with the prior large singular ‘village parking’ zone now cut up into about half a dozen smaller zones, some demarked by flags in the ground, others not so much. These change were also impacted by (sensible) renegotiations of how we would structure our fire-lanes with neighboring villages. The changes made sense at the tactical level, but they had the effect of complexifying the ‘village parking’ situation to make that parking area defacto inaccessible to Camp Contact. We ended up parking-in one of our event spaces instead, making it less accessible to city-folk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday afternoon is now the ‘start’ of burn week. We were sorting out a lot of stuff at camp on Sunday, and probably continued the ‘finishing’ phase through till Tuesday morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday, Burn week and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monday and beyond: All in all, Burn week ran pretty smoothly. The weather was generally ‘better’. The build crew was largely spent, and collectively we fought to avoid them taking on more work. The camp integration session got interrupted by a storm warning. There were still some frustrations about whether everyone was contributing, and also whether we could generate a common sense of camp identity after such discordant arrival experiences of the burn. It never feels good to see someone stand up at announcements, ask for a few volunteers to pick up stuff around camp and for the hands to come up only after a second plea for help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The changes to kitchen-shifts (an extra shift per main meal, and an extra person per shift) really seemed to help with kitchen efficiency; in the orientation we told folks that meals were at 1pm and sundown (7pm) but almost all burn week meals was an hour earlier than those times, at midday and 6pm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It seemed like water-use was really bad however; a tap was left running for possibly hours overnight, folks were using 90+ seconds of shower water instead of sub 30 seconds, folks from outside our camp were using the showers…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strike&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was not there for much of strike but it was so rough that I did head back out to the playa with Kris to bring supplies and help for a day on Wednesday/Thursday. I do not know all the ins and outs of how strike went down but I did hear that there further long-duration of duststorms/white-outs that dramatically slowed down strike. There has been a discussion on slack on what changes we can make to strike to shorten it. I might return to that later in the post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strike ended on Saturday morning (!). That is DAYS later than a regular strike for Camp Contact.  Naked Heart (village buddies) sent fiveish folks to help moop and do the final push. Collectively ‘we did it’ but this year will have lasting consequences for Camp Contact, even if BMOrg is not likely to slap us for being tardy to get off playa this year. A brutal year has left literal damage on some of our infrastructure but it has also fried a lot of the folks that were involved in leadership. I will return to what I think are the consequences of that later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, that is my very rough timeline of Camp Contact 2022 from an organizational perspective. There is so much other stuff that happened that I either did not hear about, or only have half-a-clue about it. For my own sanity, I have not tried to be comprehensive here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Reflections&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Reception recommendations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reception team should be a closely collaborating group of leads; orientation, parking, RV placement and tent placement. These leads should be identified prior to build week and during build week it is likely that they will want to recruit deputies or otherwise share coverage for these roles, as many of them ought to be high availability. As a team, looking at the village layout and whatever placement we end up getting, there should be a review of all the steps that happen after a camp contacter gets through the gates, finds camp (arrival), and is settled into camp (off-loading, parking, placement, orientation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Lead role descriptions&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orientation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring arriving camp mates into a cultural and physical sync with the camp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical: camp goers know where to find key places in camp, and what their functions are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cultural: camp goers know how things are done at camp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be highly available during key orientation times or delegate (Thursday of build to Tuesday of burn week, before main meals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Comfortable speaking in front of large groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Note: this role did not include pre-playa orientations. However, that could be integrated into this role or otherwise coordinated with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure all camp vehicles are efficiently parked in designated areas (bumper to bumper)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get new arrivals through their off-loading period as quickly as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure all camp vehicles have village parking notes in them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Liaise with other camps in village about parking plans (!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strive to park folks where they can leave playa at their desired time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be highly available or have deputies working, during peak arrival times (Sat-Monday)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know where fire-lanes (20 feet lanes) are ahead of time and keep them clear of obstructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RV Placement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Define clear RV areas (Ideally creating wind-breaks and privacy for the village)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know and communicate expectations about RVs (no shore power, no generators at night)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be available for RV placement during peak arrival times (typically Sat-Monday)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tent Placement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure dormitory structures are built as soon as possible (including flooring)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lay-out primary ‘ring’ walking lane (18 inches wide) around the dormitory structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get to ‘placement reckoning’ as soon as possible during build (might need to show up early in build to achieve this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply placement principles (And bend those principles for the build crew)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitate early conversation about tent expectations; do we want to avoid some types of tents under the shade structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine placement timings (continuous? Or clustering intervals)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly available or deputized peeps from Thursday to Tuesday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Tents that go under the shade structure&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After placing about 120 of the 135 tents that camp contacters slept in this burn, I have become very familiar with a tents of Northern America (with some curious cameos from European tent styles).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a tent placer for a ‘10 x 10’-per-person-space-allocation camp, I have a list of tents that make me sad. I will order them from saddest to least sad&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a pointy hexagon tent, ‘teepee’ style, that is about 12x12 PLUS has guide lines going everywhere. My saddest of sad tents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bell tents. Very aesthetic. Very guideliney. Very pointy. :(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weird huge tents. They are big. They are strange shapes. They have weird extensions. Sadness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large hexa/octagon tents. Some of these were 15x15 feet wide…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shiftpods; 12x12 and weird shape. I have one. It still made me sad enough to set it up outside of the shade structure to make space for others. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tents that are ten feet in one dimension but very long. These tended to fit in better and are totally fine if housing several peeps. And sometimes they were just massive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basically everything else didn’t really make me sad. Lots of 10x10 coleman pop-ups and kodiaks; very simple to place. Small tents were forever a blessing! Mini-shiftpods were a little weird but very cute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this list of things that make tent placement sad could be codified into something we as a community agree on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Anahasa village moved from corner plot to center plot in a block&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick run-down of how this caused problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not having the natural advantages of a corner plot for Arrival and initial drop-off ==&gt; We need to put extra planning into improving arrival and drop-off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Water distribution was really hard this year; is it worth changing the placing of structures to reduce the amount of hose and the amount of traffic going over them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We parked in the Alps (event space) because of weird village parking. And space at the front of camp wasn’t very utilitized while we were crowded elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dorm to dining hall trail was impinged by the showers; can we tweak placement there?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With the cram of everything else, we didn’t really have good spaces for internal camp bike ramps and bikes where everywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are probably a host of other learnings from this year about how to adapt to a new placement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Complex systems cascade: will Camp Contact recover?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think of Camp Contact as an entity over time, it is a complex emergent system that has slowly grown, and grown and added things and rumbled through the years and years of BRC and east coast shenanigans. The organizational instigation has come from Spacious, and the organizational power has come from a whole host of people sticking around for long enough to keep adding new infrastructure and new things. Do-ocarcy woo! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This emergent system has kept the camp running for a long long time; and its organizational momentum has hit a big obstacle with Covid and the two missed BRC years. Do you really need to have documentation or to write things up if enough people will be back next year? Well, you can get away with that. But we didn’t come back next year. Or the year after that! What order do we usually build things? What order do we usually strike? What is the order of operations to build the dormitory? How do we lay out the walking lanes in the dormitories? This information exists but if there aren’t enough of the people that know this information on the playa, things get weird fast. This is part of my experience with ‘Reception’; I had signed up for one thing (orientation) but soon found I did not know everything I needed to know coming into build, and that several adjacent priorities were not really being covered either. Lots of folks stepped up to fill the various gaps but when the folks that are already putting in a lot of work have to do even more, on top of one of the harshest burns in memory, we are now risking our complex system cascading into a failure state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We risk getting trapped in a vicious cycle. Where we are spread too thin due to gaps in our team, get burnt-out, as individuals don’t return and have even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; gaps in our team for next year, risking even greater problems and leading to eventual collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the way out? We certainly need to stage a series of interventions. Some possible ideas: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard-cap camp numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe even reduce numbers down from our previous highs of 170&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer and do LESS; are there things we can do without? Do we need to trim down our offerings to mitigate being overwhelmed by complexity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Document more; FYI Slack is the graveyard of corporate knowledge; all messages now disappear after three months unless we pay the big dollars. Is there some other central hub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a whole retrospective on Strike; having a strike play-book and better comms to the whole camp about strike would be a great start. Lots of camps start strike earlier than us, perhaps we need to follow suit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands now, there is a very good chance that I will not attend the next burn. On playa I was like “I want a do-over; to come back and do my job right”. And returning to my partner and sharing the stories… well, she’s not as keen. But I hope the above gives Camp Contact some documentation for the years ahead. So, I will end with a literal reiteration of my key points, and wish y’all good luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Key Difficulties&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strongest winds in BRC living memory during build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consistent and long white-outs for most of build, some of the burn and a lot of strike&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First BRC after three years for the camp; we were rusty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corporate knowledge degraded or missing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anahasa Village in center plot, not corner plot; knocked out of our regular setup and defacto rhythm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expectations across the camp about what we are being ‘asked to do’ from a regular build week did not reflect reality. This build and strike asked much more of us than normal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Summary&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This year was hard for large camps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We still made it happen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Despite the challenging external circumstances of this burn, there are plenty of ways we can do things better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camp Contact is facing an inflection point: restructure/change or collapse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am naming the orientation/parking/placement nexus as Reception, and will define roles within that area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I will tell you about how some tents make me sad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inshallah future build weeks don’t have winds like this for a while&lt;/li&gt;

If you aren’t familiar with bioregions, best to start at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/bioregional/bioregion-1/&quot;&gt;part one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious first challenge is that very few people know what Bioregionism is or what bioregions are. Or have even heard the terms at all. However, the terminology, values and related concepts around Bioregionism are more familiar to folks now than decades ago. Ecological thinking is widespread (even if ecological action is less common). Bioregional-adjacent ideas about villaging, cosmo-localism, circular or doughnut economics, ecofeminism, decolonization, right relationship to land, indigenous knowledge, and more are bubbling at the edges of society’s consciousness. So the lattice of knowledge is increasingly there for Bioregionism to be understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Handling the “What is a bioregion?” conumdrum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin promoting Bioregionism as a meme, we first have to decide our approach to handling the “What is a bioregion?” conumdrum. As mentioned in the first part of this series, there are two concepts of bioregion floating about;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WWFs purely ecological one (useful for conservationists but too narrow for wider use)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more complex and less precisely defined one that incorporates humanity’s custodial relationship to land and water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these definitions supports bioregionalism; the other ultimately distracts from it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This puts bioregionalism advocates in a bit of a tricky position; Do we push against the (current) tide of the internet, as it narrowly defines bioregions as purely ecological? Or do we cede the term bioregion and try to pivot to a different term for bioregionalism? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we consider trying to drop ‘bioregion’, it does not feel like a good option. Our circles are already somewhat brought into the terminology of bioregion - bioregionalism. Ceding disconnects us from the legacy of the bioregional congresses, Planet Drum and existing bioregion promoting groups. Pivoting to another term is probably just going to be muddying the waters even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems like pushing against the tide it is! Planting a little seed here for the build-out of a SEO savvy static website that allows folks to have a concise drop into understanding bioregionalism, with the goal of getting it into the top six results of search results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;“What is my bioregion? Show me on a map?”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally folks learning about bioregions will be curious about what their bioregion is. And depending on where one is located, that can be either straightforward or quite tricky to answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of ‘rules of thumb’ (approximations) of how to determine a bioregion. These include things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what nearby areas share this watershed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the predominant/defining flora and fauna of the nearby areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What common geological features impact this area (soil/earth, elevation, mountains)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What climatic factors are common (weather, seasonal changes, latitude, marine influence)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the patterns of human gathering in the local areas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it large enough to contain a sufficient cycling of ecological functions (nutrients, water, decomposition)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small enough that residents can tend to it and have a meaningful relationship to the region; to call it ‘home’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is contiguous (not separated by another bioregion)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, many of these criteria lead to fuzziness; your watershed, keystone species, climatic factors, human gathering patterns, etc are never going to line up into easily defined borders. Sometimes they barely overlap at all! This is an inherent feature of ecosystems; they are interlinked in multi-faceted ways.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human gathering and our patterns of life also introduce significant complexity; sharp borders beget questions of inclusion and exclusion, and while ‘human-scale’ gives us a taste of how to answer the ‘how big is too big’ question, it leaves a lot to one’s judgement. This confusion is in part the &lt;em&gt;appeal&lt;/em&gt; of the WWF bioregions and schemes build on top of that, such as the One Earth bioregions. Cut out the human aspect and it is simpler! (but in the eyes of bioregionalists, less impactful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my readings of prior Bioregional congresses and other bioregionist writings, the above conundrums have been touched on and ultimately bypassed by having folks self-elect their own bioregion; If someone asks “What’s my bioregion?”, we answer “You tell me!“. This works great for folks that have already got a solid conception of bioregionalism and/or its associated tenets. However, 1) as described above, there aren’t many folks who have a solid concept of it 2) the defacto “You tell me” isn’t very helpful when trying to promote bioregionalism more widely, and 3) the self-election method is also tricky to apply to the map context, something near and dear to my heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;So you have decided to add bioregions to your map…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is where I would end up. I am going to take a hard-turn into this specific bioregion related rabbit-hole; putting bioregions on maps. I do not think this is the only Bioregionism-promotion rabbit hole worth digging into but it is one that I have been wrestling with recently. Hylo, the prosocial coordination platform I am working on with the &lt;a href=&quot;terran.io&quot;&gt;Terran Collective&lt;/a&gt;, wants to connect folks based on place-based community ties, including their bioregion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps we display to help folks see their community in a spatial context are a natural branching point to introduce them to ‘their bioregion’. And, as a web and phone application, we are not sure how to facilitate asking a user all the possible questions they might need to be able to tell us what their bioregion is. Nor it is clear exactly what technological backing or data we need to back the code part of that process. I do have some ideas about how we might approach putting bioregions on a map, but first I want to lay out as many of the traps and challenges that one might encounter during such as effort.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Legbility and cartography&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining things on a map is very much an activity bound up with making something more legible. Legibility itself sounds lovely and benign; of course we want to make things understandable to others. However, the extreme pursuit of legibility by some of the defining entities of modernism has caused all sorts of systemic havoc. Nation-states, bureaucracies (both state and corporate) and the education systems have a habit of steam-rolling nuance and defacto ignoring important system features because they are difficult to make legible (cue references to Seeing like a State).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern cartography is absolutely wrapped up in this. As we emerge out of that tradition, we must strive to avoid defaulting to the well-worn patterns and expectations in cartography that would take us to the extremes of legibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest examples of this in the bioregional context are administrative borders; whether they are borders for countries, states or even down to county/shire/city level. These borders tend to separate the governance and coordination of eco-systems and human communities. These administrative borders solve many problems associated to improving legibility of territory to state and corporate bureacracies. This results in a steam-rolling of nuance (something ecosystems and communities have a lot of). Bioregionalism rejects these administrative divisions as coordinating tools/concepts. As such, any map scheme for bioregions ought to be at least consistent across a whole continent, and not bound to existing administrative borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important legibility concern is that the criteria that we use to define a bioregion may not be available or easily transfered into a legible data sources; we can find good map data on watersheds, but defining keystone species and their territories is much harder. When something is more legible, more measurable, there can be an implicit bias towards tracking and understanding those factors over others. This feeds into a common data challenge of criteria selection, and determining what attributes to even consider for defining a given data type (bioregion in this instance).&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The gazetter and neighbourhood problems&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gazetteer is a index of names for an area. When you start trying to compile one of these, you get problems. Folks refer to different levels of place in very different ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you are standing in Oakland, California. But you are also in ‘the bay area’, ‘the east bay’, and ‘the town’. You are on Ohlone land. You are near Montclair and Piedmont and Rockridge, but which of those is your neighbourhood? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the breath of those last sentences, I have transitioned from the gazetter problems (what names do people call places) to the neighourhood problem (If I’m at the intersection of several places, which one is “local” to me, which is mine?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These problems apply to bioregions (just like most geographical concepts). Again, if I am standing in Oakland, I probably have a good case to say I’m standing in the Bay Area Bioregion. But maybe its the The Bay Delta Bioregion, to emphazise the importance of the California Delta? If I’m standing in Oakland, sure, the “Bay Delta Bioregion” does do a pretty good of encompassing the lands and waters that make up my bioregion. However, if I’m at the north-eastern reaches of the Delta, perhaps Sacramento or Stockton have a bigger gravity in my concept of ‘local’, and I consider them in my ‘hood’ vs Oakland? Or what if we consider them all apart of the same bioregion?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Defining bioregions as a full set&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining a single bioregion can take a little back-and-forth but if you have spent enough time in a place, you can usually have a fairly decent go at it. Now define the neighboring bioregions, and their neighbors, and so on. To start we hit the difficulty of defining bioregions we aren’t local to, and risk once again drawing lines through communities or ecologies we don’t understand, for the sake of drawing lines on a map. On top of that risk, we also bump into the challenge of how we define all bioregions in concert, as a set. If we start with a few easy obvious ones and then fill in the gaps between them, we can run into odd ‘left-overs’ of territory, that don’t seems to belong to their neighbors but can’t constitute a bioregion of their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor to consider when thinking about bioregions as a set, is how consistently we apply criteria across them (or not). For example, in the full set, does it make sense to include physically massive bioregions along side vastly smaller ones? Is there some consistency in how we think about bioregions across the whole set? Arguably, we could have different variances in criteria between different continents; as long as there was some sort of internal coherence for all bioregions that were directly connected. For example, we could consider the Darien Gap as a pivot bioregion between north and south America, and have two different schemes for everything north and everything south of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Problematic boundaries&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things on maps tend to have discrete boundaries; we are used to them having discrete boundaries, and the technology and culture around map-making tends to expect things to have discrete boundaries. These sharp lines, traced through the air on to land and sea, cut ecological systems and sometimes communities, off from effective coordination. Bioregions, as an ecological concept, rejects that sharp division. In part that is a philosophical stance from Bioregionalism, and in part it is a pragmatical acknowledgement that the flora, fauna and flows of an ecology do not care for these invisible lines. The more that climate chaos and ecological imbalance inject into our lives, the more we are forced to recognize that pragmatic revelation. And still we have to reckon with how to handle the fuzzy borders of bioregions, especially because the edges of two different ecologies can be some of the most important, dynamic and diverse places ecologically speaking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is human scale?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human scale speaks to the idea that our built environments and our concept of ‘local’ or ‘home’ have a sweet spot in scale of being conducive to daily life. For urban planning, that usually means focusing on a certain vibe of medium density living, with good walkability, bicycle lifestyle, and for larger populations, a good public transit layer on top of that. And not orienting our built environment for larger vehicles. This could be be a concept applied to whole cities but also village and town centers. For a bioregional context, it is more a limit on what anyone of us could consider home, or the land and water where we live where we can maintain a meaningful relationship and stewardship of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of that applies to my own bioregion, the region of the Sierra foothills that are bound by the Bear and Yuba rivers. While the foothills over a hundred miles south or north of us are ecologically very similar to this region, I cannot say that I have a tangible relationship to those places. And while I love Tahoe, the peaks and passes of the Sierras do separate us from a different ecology and bioregion up there and over towards Nevada, despite sharing a county with some of that region (and certainly being a close sibling bioregion). Human scale also speaks to the human settlements in a region and their &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; for greater coordination; Do they share ecological realities where deeper coordination could unlock greater flourishing? This isn’t to suppose that coordination should be limited to this level. Just that it should be the first place we look to meet our needs and collaborate on stewardship of the land and water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Applying all of this to figuring out a map&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, a great deal of fuzziness can stem from trying to put this all into a mapping scheme for bioregions. Is there a formula for the right density population mix for a bioregion while still trying to keep within human-scale? Does that still correspond with the potential possibility for shared community of a region? Can we even meaningfully attempt to do any of this without direct input from locals of a bioregion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lay out a few ways of grappling with how to apply this all to a mapping scheme in the next piece in this series.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bioregionalism on the Internet (Part 1)]]></title><description><![CDATA[A Knave’s look at Bioregionalism “All the cool kids from the in-group are talking about Bioregionalism.

&lt;p&gt;“All the cool kids from the in-group are talking about Bioregionalism. From the context of their conversations, you’ve figured out it has something to do with the environment and rethinking how we coordinate society but you want to learn more. You pull up your favorite search engine and type in a few terms like ‘what is a bioregion’ and ‘Bioregionalism’…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would indulge me, may I save you the trouble of fumbling around the internet and give you a rundown of my own version of this little journey?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is it like for someone to do 20 minutes of reading about bioregions and Bioregionalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, everyone’s search will vary, based on search term, their location, search engine etc. Common resources that pop up include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dictionary definitions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The World Wilderness Fund (WWF)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And random little explanations from odds corners of different sites (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ibiblio.org/london/links/start-392001/msg00549.html&quot;&gt;One such corner is a year 2000 post on a mailing list&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What do they say about bioregions?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one starts to read the various resources, slowly we find that &lt;strong&gt;there seem to be two different understandings of what a ‘bioregion’ is&lt;/strong&gt;. One is a purely ecological understanding; a bioregion defines some sort of identifiable ecosystem. And the other definition seems closer to what the in-group has been going on about; bioregions being ecologically defined &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; integrating the human communities and their stewardship. As we work down the above list of resources, what do we find?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The dictionary definitions that pop up favor the purely ecological&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wikipedia on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioregion&quot;&gt;‘bioregion’&lt;/a&gt; only covers the ecological concept of bioregions; If you find the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioregionalism&quot;&gt;entry for Bioregionalism&lt;/a&gt;, it has an overview and touches on the two different concepts of ‘bioregions’ (one purely ecological and one that is ecological and ‘human scale’ to facilitate the humans role/relationship to the land). The ‘bioregion’ entry doesn’t even link to the ‘Bioregionalism’ entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The WWF, with ecoregions and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oneearth.org/bioregions-2020/&quot;&gt;One Earth’s bioregions&lt;/a&gt;, follow purely ecological lines. These definitions are handy for conservation efforts but typically too large or non-contiguous to be human-scale. For example in the One Planet scheme, the West coast of North America has three bioregions, each of which is close to or larger than California. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all in all, if I was newly discovering the concept of bioregions, and I was relying on the internet, I would mainly think they were just ecologically defined and that there is not much more to them than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t sound like the Bioregionalism that the in-group cool kids were talking about! It sounded like a coordinating concept for organizing humans’ relationships to land, sea and each other. Having Bioregionalism have one definition of bioregion that is overshadowed by a different definition of bioregion… not a great situation for clarity and spreading the good word.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What do bioregionalists say about bioregions?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where are we hearing about bioregions being more than purely ecological? From those pesky bioregionalists!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That random post on a year 2000 mailing list? It has a great definition of what makes up a bioregion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such an area must be &lt;strong&gt;large&lt;/strong&gt; enough to maintain the integrity of the region’s biological communities, habitats, and ecosystems; to support important ecological processes, such as nutrient and waste cycling, migration, and stream flow; to meet the habitat requirements of keystone and indicator species; and to include the human communities involved in the management, use, and understanding of biological resources. It must be &lt;strong&gt;small&lt;/strong&gt; enough for local residents to consider it home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And only recently did I find this succint definition from the bioregion.org.uk mob in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bioregion_uk&quot;&gt;twitter bio&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bioregion is an area of land &amp;#x26; water whose limits are defined not by political boundaries, but by the geographical limits of communities &amp;#x26; ecological systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then a Raymond and a Peter (Peter passed in 2011, RIP) seem big in the scene and had &lt;a href=&quot;https://cascadiabioregion.org/what-is-bioregionalism&quot;&gt;something to say&lt;/a&gt; about what a bioregion is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bioregion can be determined initially by use of climatology, physiography, animal and plant geography, natural history and other descriptive natural sciences. The final boundaries of a bioregion, however, are best described by the people who have lived within it, through human recognition of the realities of living-in-place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an ecologically minded sort, who has been getting more and more curious about humanity’s relationship to land, air and sea. These are the definitions of bioregion that interest me and, as we have seen in our search, it takes a bit of digging to get to them. They interest me because I have come to believe that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing our personal and communal relationships to the land and sea are needed for society to have longevity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The administrative division of ecologies by county, city, state, province, shire and country borders actively gets in the way of human coordination, particularly ecological or land-sea-air-relating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What then, is Bioregionalism?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its simplest terms, the ecologically-sound organization and coordination of society via bioregions. Can I find more of that in a twenty minute internet search? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dictionaries fail us once again. “Advocacy of the belief that human activity should be largely &lt;em&gt;restricted&lt;/em&gt; to distinct ecological and geographical regions.* (Emphasize is mine). Human activity restricted? That does not sound accurate nor appealing at all. Wikipedia does a better job than the dictionary; “Bioregionalism is a philosophy that suggests that political, cultural, and economic systems are more sustainable and just if they are organized around naturally defined areas called bioregions”. As we read further into our search, we find a palette of different concepts and tenets that self-identified bioregionalist hold as being part of Bioregionalism, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reinhabitation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Governance in accord with nature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human-scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decentralization of power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consensus or consent decision-making&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecofeminism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stewardship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humanity as custodians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Environmental restoration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ceremonial companionship (with nature)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regenerative culture/economics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indigenous ways of being/knowing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I am not here attempting to decode what these concepts mean, nor declare any set of them greater than another; just to give the reader a sense of the scene. Speaking of the scene, it would appear that Bioregionalism as a movement was active in the 70s and 80s, revived again in the 2000s and since Peter’s passing in 2011, has been somewhat awash on the tides of the internet (outside of a few key torch bearers). However, there is a recent wider upswell in Bioregionalism, coinciding with the rising awareness of climate chaos and memes such as regenerative culture/economics, Doomer-Optimism, and Deep-Adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I promised you a run down of “bioregion” and “Bioregionalism”. You know there are two definitions running around of a bioregion, and that only one links to Bioregionalism. All definitions of ‘bioregion’ are ecologically focused but only some are trying to tie in the added complexity of human coordination. And Bioregionalism is a movement striving to use bioregions as a key coordinating concept for our lives. Perhaps your curiosity is sated, and it is time for you to continue on your merry way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you feel inclined, let me invite you, dear reader, deeper into the mysteries of these matters, and &lt;a href=&quot;/bioregional/bioregion-2/&quot;&gt;sharing the good word of Bioregionalism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While I am familiar with the process required to get orthorecitified imagery mosaics for mapping purposes, I had never gone through the whole process myself. But alas, I am not (to my knowledge ;) ) a government agency, scrappy startup or tech enterprise giant with lots of funding! Whatever am I to do? So I researched how feasible it is to make aerial imagery mosaics with as minimal outlay as possible. I was pleasantly surprised at how doable it is today! Finally I could get my personal photo mosaics, ‘hand-made’, ‘bespoke’, ‘artisan’ and ‘consciously sourced’! ;P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of providing an updated aerial photo mosaic to intentional communities in the region, so this walk-through of how I went through the photo mosaic process follows my attempt at doing this for the first time. I looked at many options for how to do all the pieces of the process and in the end I settled on using my DJI Mavic Pro, Drone Harmony for mission planning and Open Drone Maps. If you aren’t a mapping/imagery nerd, buckle up, it’s going to get jargony at points but the results are worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Research phase&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research included checking out a range of open-source and low-cost tooling in the drone mapping space. The minimum three pieces of software needed for drone mapping include mission planning software (how you instruct the drone what needs to be collected), mission control software (how you execute the mission and control the drone in the field) and something to perform the image processing and mosaicing. I did check out a range of options, each of which fulfilled one or more of those roles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hivemapper.com&quot;&gt;hivermapper&lt;/a&gt; gives you mission planning, and free processing, at the cost of them getting to use your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dronedeploy.com&quot;&gt;DroneDeploy&lt;/a&gt; offers the whole package; mission planning, mission control and processing services, for small-scale operators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dronemapper&quot;&gt;DroneMapper&lt;/a&gt; Seems legacy. You pay an annual license to run the processing software on your own hardware. Windows only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapsmadeeasy.com/&quot;&gt;Maps Made Easy&lt;/a&gt; Image processing. Free for small scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.opendronemap.org/&quot;&gt;OpenDroneMap&lt;/a&gt; Open-source image processing, with cool community, free command line tool and pay-for-use GUI version&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://flylitchi.com/&quot;&gt;Litchi&lt;/a&gt; Mainly mission control, with a little bit of mission planning. One time purchase of $36&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://droneharmony.com/&quot;&gt;Drone Harmony&lt;/a&gt; Mission control and mission planning package. Free two week trial, then paid subscription.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the general adage of “Cost, time and quality: pick two”, I was seeking the lowest cost and lowest time combination of all the above. I did settle on Drone Harmony (being willing to spend a little cash here to make mission planning and control smooth and reliable) and OpenDroneMap for the processing (it was open-source and easy to use). DroneDeploy looked quick (especially since it offered the complete package) and quality, at a cost, so was also a very tempting option. After all this research and my choices, I also found out about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ugcs.com/&quot;&gt;UgCS&lt;/a&gt;, which looks like a competitive alternative to Drone Harmony and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pix4d.com/&quot;&gt;PIX4D&lt;/a&gt; who seem to have a pretty comprehensive offering, akin to DroneDeploy.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Mission Planning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terrain and features of the area where you want to make an image mosaic unsurprisingly as an impact on mission planning. I wanted to collect over a 80 acre, heavily forested area, that also included some decent elevation change. I also wanted to have a crack at getting a data-set that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be processed into a 3D model, even if that was not my overall goal. It’d just be cool to see how easy or hard that was in this day and age! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elevation change over the collection area meant I needed to have terrain-aware mission planning. Otherwise, if all the images were taken from the same flight elevation (height above sea level), the relative distance to the ground would be varied across all the images. This could lead to wonky stitching of the mosaic. This helped me pick Drone Harmony over other options; they had an obvious terrain-aware mission planning option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavily forested terrain falls in the general category of ‘complex terrain’. The trees do a few things that impact on the photo mosaic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tall things cast long shadows. This would be less obvious if I was collecting in the middle of summer (when the sun was more overhead) but I had to collect during the end of Autumn, start of Winter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feature height variation. Big changes in height makes 3D modelling uglier and more error prone, unless you add supplemental collection missions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Synthetic ground control point challenges. The image processing software can roughly align each image in space based on the sensor orientation (pose) and the drone’s GPS positioning but to improve precision and to coordinate the images together, it relies on seeing the same feature (like a corner of the asphalt where two roads meet) in multiple images to pull them all into alignment. These features can be considered a form of synthetic ground control point (GCPs for short), used to orthorecitify the whole mosaic (I promise those are real words in the remote-sensing realm, for those readers who are not map nerds). Big trees reduce the number of images that one of those GCPs could be seen in. Lots of big trees all together preclude some images from sharing GCPs altogether, meaning they cannot be easily stitched together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This meant that I would need to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run missions as close together as possible (so the shadows wouldn’t change position), &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From higher than necessary (one, avoid running the drone into trees and two, higher drone =&gt; wider image footprint =&gt; higher chance that an image would include a GCP)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a higher level of image overlap, to account for the higher risk that GCPs might not be visible in neighbouring images and &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Otherwise, I could try to run extra missions to collect more angles of everything in the hope that this would make the 3D model doable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got some &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.opendronemap.org/t/mission-planning-for-heavily-forested-80-acres-on-slope/5664&quot;&gt;advice from the Open Drone Map community&lt;/a&gt; and settled on my missions: two separate missions, one running north-south, one 20° skewed. Both higher than normal, both with over 70% front/back and sides overlap. And with the sensor panned 5° up from nadir (nadir =&gt; looking straight down). With all that, I took to Drone Harmony to build out these missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Drone Harmony&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These missions were very achievable in Drone Harmony. The only extra step I needed to take was to provide a digital elevation model (DEM) to the browser-based mission planning interface, so that Drone Harmony could adjust the flight elevation of the drone in line with the changes in terrain elevation below it. This was a fun little moment to drop back into my early career Geographic Information Systems (GIS) skills. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/&quot;&gt;downloaded the appropriate DEM&lt;/a&gt; as a raster from the US Geological Survey, loaded it into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.qgis.org/en/site/&quot;&gt;QGIS&lt;/a&gt;, clipped the DEM raster to a smaller size, so it would meet the mission planner’s upload limits and then uploaded it! There were a few trials and errors in this process, to get the final clipped down DEM raster to be small enough for Drone Harmony.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the DEM ready, I just needed to outline my mission area, set the parameters for each of my missions, and then sync those missions back to the cloud. Once the plans were synced to the cloud, they were available for me to download on the Drone Harmony mission controller application, which in my case I was running on an Android phone. The regular DJI Mavic Pro setup allows you to control the drone via a combination of hooking your smart phone into the Mavic Pro remote controller. The Drone Harmony mission controller would take over the software role that was usually provided by the DJI flight controller software. After downloading the plans to my Android device, I was ready to fly!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First collection effort&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with all my planning, I still didn’t know how the missions that I had built out would fair with the realities of the battery life of my drone. When I launched my first collection effort, I found out that this had a big impact. I needed to fly two missions to get all the data I wanted. I launched the first mission, all very smooth with the Drone Harmony mission controlling app, and watched the drone go to work. As the drone captured image after image, I saw its mission progress matched against its remaining battery. I hadn’t even got to the half-way point of the first mission before I hit the battery limit (about 30%) where I usually land the drone. I pushed the drone to finish just over half way and rushed it back to the landing spot. Landed with less than 10% battery… something that does not feel comfortable at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only had two functioning batteries, so now I was going to have a big gap between the collections for my first mission and my second, since I’d need to charge the batteries between them. This would mean I would have two sets of images with very different shadows in them, causing weirdness when they are photo mosaiced and increasing the risk of other image glitches. Boo! I finished the missions anyway, keen to see what the results were like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First processing effort&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing with OpenDroneMap was alarming easy. I already had Docker downloaded, and after bumping up its memory allocation (to help with all the image processing it was about to be running), I just had to drop the images on to my laptop and pop a simple command line instruction into a terminal prompt: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;docker run -ti --rm -v /Users/twatson/datasets:/datasets opendronemap/odm --project-path /datasets round1 --dsm&lt;/code&gt; The result was pretty legit at a first glance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that the collection area I started with was a large rectangle and this resulting image is an unusual smaller shape. The difference is a result of images that were thick with many homogenous trees. These images could not be meaningfully stitched into the larger mosaic with the other images. Try stitching a bunch of these together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the image quality while largely decent, there were a bunch of image glitches (often referred to as processing artifacts). Here is a sample, including some wonky tennis court lines and wonky asphalt, and a pool slide that certainly does not curve like &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I actually rolled out a two week trial for PIX4D and tried the processing there. The big learning from that was the impressive processing metadata report that PIX4D produced, alerting me that more than half the images were unable to be used because of various issues; incorrect sensor pose, lack of GCPs to tie the images together and other issues. The big gap between the two collection missions (to recharge the batteries), with there different shadows, certainly didn’t help in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did mess about with the processing a little and tried to get images from both missions to process (again with some advice from the OpenDroneMap community). You can see how ugly that got in this next image&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Second collection effort&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily I got to visit this spot a few times over the last few months. I wanted to collect a better base dataset for processing, so I redid the missions I had planned, tweaking a few of the parameters but most importantly, I reduced the area of the mission significantly. Those extra images of trees-on-trees-on-trees weren’t going to be processed anyway, so they were easy to clip out of the new mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These missions were achievable with under one battery of flight each, so much more manageable. I was lucky with the light on one morning; the sun was veiled behind long thin clouds. This took the sharp edges off the shadows, while there still being enough light to pick out features. Collection was seemless through the Drone Harmony mission controller, and once I got home, processing ran smoothly (although I should note that &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenDroneMap/ODM/releases&quot;&gt;OpenDroneMap also got updates&lt;/a&gt; in the gap between the different processing runs, so that could have improved things as well).

&lt;p&gt;There is a growing movement of folk who are seeking a way out of the dominant paradigm for living life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not new; but recently it is building up once more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Folks are yearning for a renewed way of living, and an escape from the destinations that the dominant paradigm is taking us&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atomization of community; more individualist and market-mediated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecological chaos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Drowning in busyness, noise, data, and incoherence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amnesia about the injustices of the past, that are still alive today&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is primarily a question of culture, and of how a new culture can be cultivated. Most of the time, culture is part organic chaotic process and part tightly clutched levers of culture generation that tend to be used in service to the existing status quo. These can be wrestled over, but the obvious levers of cultural change are inaccessible for most. What other ways are folks seeking to cultivate culture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community building is a solid mechanism for cultivating and continuing culture. The process of creating a bastion for a distinct set of values and behaviors to become established and to demonstrate a different way of being. These communities have the potential to be containers for the experiences, work and relationships that connect and transform us. This is the potential of transformational community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating something new is hard though. I really appreciated the words a writer shared about this on &lt;a href=&quot;https://ecosystemguild.org/2020/10/15/enabling-conditions-for-restoration/?fbclid=IwAR0JK0je2PdAEp_-2E-AkcB_2MyqGblnY1NwHq1cqvUyu1hhGJhnrCXT4m4&quot;&gt;The Ecosystem Guild blog&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good restoration labor is enabled by the coincidence of circumstances–the right resources, knowledge and labor arrive at the right place at the right time.  While we spend lots of time lining up these conditions.  &lt;strong&gt;That enabling effort is necessary, but is not the work of restoration itself.&lt;/strong&gt;  Right now we struggle to create enabling conditions around each new project.  &lt;strong&gt;This is because we are attempting restoring outside of a culture of restoration.&lt;/strong&gt;  We not only must do the labor, but we must laboriously build the foundation upon which the laborer must stand.  Under these conditions, we spend too many resources to accomplish too little as our damaged earth continues to unravel.  However if we can lay a broad enough foundation the regeneration of the earth will be relatively simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, the writer focuses on the frame of restoration; one I’m quite partial to, but the point generalizes to anyone seeking to create transformational divergent culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pull of the enticing parts of the mainstream paradigm will continue to tug at individual community members and any divergent community. Everyone is bringing their baggage (and their gifts!) into the community, and this needs to be integrated, lest it sour the culture. And, we are all trying to make sense of our lineages, our behaviors and our dreams while trying to forge a new way forward; how can we find out what works and be gentle with ourselves and others when we need to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last piece, of seeing so many yearning for something more, to better themselves and their communities, gives me heart. Even if we have different backgrounds, different ideas for what is needed, and different goals, I seek to look at these folk as my fellow travelers on these unknown paths to the next evolution of society.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagining now: Us-two* look out and see us on all these overlapping paths, striving. Us-two notice our fellow travelers, doing many things differently to what us-two do and to what is done in the context of our communities. We expect this and appreciate it; maybe they will find a way-of-being that we all need and can learn from! And, despite that, as we watch, us-two feel our voice gurgling up from our gut and speaking up, “Hey wait, before you go, what about…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;* invoking Tyson Yunkaporta’s use of the first person plural from &lt;strong&gt;Sand Talk&lt;/strong&gt;; you and I, us-two.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because while we need divergence and difference, we also have hints, guesses and impulses about what we do need to converge on. There are baseline aspects to these communities to ensure their transformational efforts ‘go the distance’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, before we all dive head-long into these long projects, lets talk about what we need to build that foundation and go the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is needed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the clues I am paying attention to, for transformational communities to go the distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intergenerational integration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having rich inner and outer orientations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Evolutionary ritual, ceremony and tradition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embracing the good and the bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right relationship to land&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flourishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Intergenerational integration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformational communities have to integrate and appeal to folks spread across a range of life-stages. It is a fairly fundamental issue if there is no place for folks in the community as they transition into different stages of life. Longevity for a community is easier to reach when there is a role, and a place for a community member when they are a child, an adolescent, a young adult, an adult in their prime, a parent (or extra aunty/uncle), and an elder. Beyond the concern for longevity, this mix of life-stages lends important perspective and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catering for all life-stages leads naturally to greater stewardship; a sense of contributing to the land and community in ways that will serve those that will come after us. This sense of continuity and care is prevalent in indigenous cultures globally, and, sadly, is disrupted, absent or narrow in the logic of the globalised economy. If we yearn for true longevity, inherent with that comes the need for long-term vision, long-term thinking and true stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rites of Passage are a vital means for communities to mark, recognize and tie together folks as they move through these life-stages. This form of ritual provides a structured, intentional and communal way of &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; each member of the community, as they pass life-stage thresholds. The mainstream paradigm still has some of these rituals, weddings and funerals being the most obvious. However, honoring and observing other life-stages are patchy at best. Those connected to our developmental years are particularly close to my heart, as I have &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/priors/initiation/&quot;&gt;shared before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it is just the Australian in me, but while much of intergenerational integration is seeking to make a community and culture attractive for folks at all life-stages, there is something both healthy and inevitable about getting a community’s young adults out to be initiated by the wider world. There absolutely must be other ways for the world at large to be woven into community life. &lt;em&gt;And&lt;/em&gt; young adults need to be supported to explore in this developmental period of wider curiosity, maturation, and discovery, and cut their own path in some fashion. Without this, communities risk alienating their youth and risk losing an important way of connecting to the wider world through their adventures and choices. This blends right into the next community clue; Inner and outer work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Inner/Outer Work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the distinct levels of the self, the pair, the group, the community and the wider world, there are important communal implications stemming from the inner and outer life of each. Having complete knowledge of that sort of complex system is unfathomable; I do not want to suggest that as a goal. However, sharing context across the interconnected parts of relationships and communities, in meaningful &amp;#x26; efficient ways, is critical for humans of any large number to co-exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been delighted to learn about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.prosocial.world/&quot;&gt;Prosocial Process&lt;/a&gt;, a way to facilitate better conversations in communities. This process includes the ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) matrix exercise; mapping how an individual’s inner world (thoughts, feelings, sense-making) maps to the outer word (words, actions). This jumps straight into one of the most important facets of inner/outer work; Context sharing. The continued sharing of context can be repeated at the community or group level, to surface the inner world of a group’s dynamics and context, and how that can impact the group’s functioning. This context-sharing facilitates one of the key facets of a focus on inner/outer work; the cycle of sense-making that moves and surfaces context between these different levels.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without this regular exchange of the different inner and outer contexts, I fear it is easier for a transformational community to slip into a failure mode; changing community form or just dissolving. What does it look like when elements of this are missing? Daniel Christian Wahl used the &lt;a href=&quot;https://jimruttshow.blubrry.net/daniel-christian-wahl-2/&quot;&gt;‘lifeboat’ description&lt;/a&gt; of communities that have an inward-focused richness of connection, and a blindspot to what is happening elsewhere. That to me looks like having good context sharing at the self, pair and community level but with a disconnection from the wider world. Communities that might do quite well at looking after their tiny own land but abdicate a role in the rest of existence. A different example is NGOs or non-profits that have transformational goals but replicate destructive power dynamics in their group function could be seen as missing the self, pair and/or community levels of inner and outer work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inner and outer work is more than context/information sharing. It is also touching on the idea of ‘doing the work’, ranging from our own inner worlds to the outer perspective of the world around us. Without a directed effort to create richness and flourishing in all the different inner and outer worlds to which a community connects to, it is hard to know how that community seeks to be transformative. I’m sure there have been some unintentional transformative communities in the past, but I am working on the assumption that it is more likely when you make it an explicit goal!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Evolutionary Ritual, Ceremony &amp;#x26; Tradition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how we embody our culture. How we make it tangible. Ritual and ceremony gives us a place in time to take our inner world and mark its shape in the outer world. I resonate strongly with the sentiment of ceremony as an invocation of kairos time, a pausing in the dominant pace of time. To quickly distinguish the two, “regular” time, chronos time, is the time that is measured and kairos time is the time that matters. This makes ritual and ceremony more distinct, more memory forming, than the normal group interactions of an organization or community. Although, even if ritual, ceremony or a form of kairos time are not invoked, communities or organizations will have processes, ‘traditions’ and/or habits that carry and embody some form of culture, no matter how accidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being subjected to hollow ritual, ceremony or tradition that one does not connect with is an increasingly common experience; witness the droves of folk leaving their raised religion behind for another religion, spirituality or secular life. This makes getting collective buy-in and organic development of ceremony particularly important for newly coalescing communities. I sense that the need and benefit that ritual and ceremony could bring to communal life does not uniformly match the desire for it in my contemporaries; we have lost our sense of its value and need to have it gently coaxed back into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ritual and ceremony are the community manifestations of humanity’s superpower; the creation of meaning. It is how we imbue the lives we lead in a collective with meaning and depth. This superpower can be used for good, evil and indifferent outcomes. There are unnumbered examples of rituals, ceremonies and traditions that create cultures of subjugation, abuse, harm and dysfunction. Acknowledging this does not mean we ought to reject ritual and ceremony. We must seek to build ritual and ceremony that resonates with our values and, with great care and wisdom, we must push the practices and traditions we create to evolve over time. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of evolutionary tradition may seem a little paradoxical at first glance. Tradition invokes a sense of unchanging, old, enduring. And yet, as we scratch at the paint on the surface of many ‘traditions’ of today, we find that they are barely generations old, often created for less than valorous reasons. On the other end of the spectrum, some cultures carry on traditions that were practical advice millennia ago (for example: don’t eat swine, it has lots of parasites) but that is now just ossified custom now. So we have at least two different challenges here that boil down to a common theme; we honor the ‘what’ or ‘how’ of a tradition, but we have lost some or all connection to the real ‘why’. How we can synthesize, recreate, remake and evolve our traditions is an open question; one that any transformational community &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; grapple with. It is wise not leave this to chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Seeking the good, without denying the difficult&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common false choice we face is that between idealism and realism. Idealism is the yearning to see the best in people and possibilities, with the counterpart of realism as seeing the limitations of situations, and the lower motivations and intentions coming out of folks. It is easy for us to fall into the false choice between the two of them. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46147242-nordic-ideology&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nordic Ideology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Freinacht frames a way out of this; we should avoid game-denial (idealism) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; game-acceptance (realism). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, if we seek to avoid this false choice, we can pursue game-change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game-change is acknowledging that the ‘game’ of modern life as we play it today exists, with its status-games, economics and power structures. And that while we must operate with that knowledge and understanding, we seek to change the rules, and play a different sort of game (or as Tim Koelkebeck said in conversation recently, not just a different game but instead a different dance). Acknowledging game-change as a goal is the easy first step. What is challenging is to “surf the wave” and to not get sucked into game-denial or dumped into game-acceptance. This pursuit of game-change is deeply tied to how a community is managing its inner and outer work and orientations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we strive to change the rules of the game, and we create delightful pockets of new culture at a community level, we can never turn our back on this: &lt;em&gt;Not everyone we encounter is playing the same game&lt;/em&gt;. There are many games being played, even within the mainstream paradigm. Most are benign or neutral but a select few actively oppose the creation of change, acting as a form of antibody response to anything outside of norm. Avoiding, deflecting and preventing bad interactions with folks playing those games is vastly preferred to having to react in the moment to difficult situations. Transformational communities absolutely need to be interconnected to other groups, and their surrounds, while also being attuned to the risk of folks playing by different rules.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we handle those playing by different rules, and those violating the norms of community? Communities need to have their own answers to this. The larger a community grows, the more these answers need to be articulated and consented to. One really does not want to be in the middle of a community crisis and trying to figure these answers out. There need to be practices and answers for what justice looks like within a community and, also how the community orients to justice in the context of the rest of humanity. We must be fierce &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; kind in our defence of the cultures we are cultivating, and exclusion from community has to be an option for significant transgressions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close this section, let us return to the headline theme; the good and the bad. This clue for transformational community is also about embodying a holistic sense of the human experience. We need to have that depth; joy and sorrow, the sacred and the profane, the good and the bad. This theme weaves through many of the clues discussed; the highs and lows of we experience as we progress through our life-stages, the ways we mark and acknowledge that with ritual and tradition, and the inner &amp;#x26; outer work we have to do to unlock the great things in life and process the difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Right relationship to land&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of ‘civilizational progress’ over the last few hundred years has included a separation and opposition between Us and Nature. We have divorced ourselves from Nature, and in doing so have become disconnected from our own nature (the part of Nature inside us) and caused considerable harm to the planet that sustains us. Communities of all forms need to find new (or old) ways of having right relationship to the land, from both an ecological and metaphorical sense. This separation has siblings in imperalism and colonialism. Not only did some societies divorce themselves from nature but they crushed and colonized connected-to-Nature societies across the globe. We cannot divorce ourselves from this legacy; as we attempt to return to right relationship to land, we must work towards and figure out how to come to right relationship to those peoples who have been dispossessed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right relationship extends to both the land on which we stand (our local context), and the land on which we draw (our whole bioregion and the globe). We cannot meaningfully be in right relation if we focus on only one of those two frames about the land we are connected to. We currently experience life in a vast globalized economy. We cannot build an ecological paradise in our area while defacto exporting our ecological impact to other regions. This has both equity and systems implications; we cannot perpetuate pushing our problems on to other populations, and the reality is that our ecological systems are globally connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond recognizing the pitfalls of a metaphorical separation from Nature, what is our story about our relationship and connection to Nature? Tyson Yunkaporta shares the matter-of-fact reality that we are enmeshed into the web of life and that we have a responsibility to be the custodian species of Earth. This is just a given in the lineages Tyson is connected to, and the lineages of other Australian indigenous communities. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45449501-sand-talk&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sand Talk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tyson is clear that being a custodial species does not place us above the rest of nature but places us in a complex network of relationships and responsibilities. Stepping into our place as the custodial species, listening for the rhythm of the complex adaptive systems that ecologies represent, and learning how to gently balance, restore and integrate would be the epitome of finding right relationship to the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Flourishing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first five clues to community so far covered mainly focus on the ‘how’ of transformational community; what characteristics keep community relevant, impactful, and whole. With the idea of custodial species and this section’s theme of flourishing, we touch on the ‘why’. What are the goals for transformational community; Why should we even do any of this at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am suggesting several clues for ‘how’ communities need to be, a lot of diversity, divergence and difference is necessary in the ‘why’ of community. This diversity is both what is needed for humanity to flourish as a whole, and a necessary reality that reflects the different contexts, desires and visions that folks have. The one goal-oriented clue I do suggest is a focus on human development and the concept of flourishing as a way of being.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the juice that drives community, and integrating it with the ‘how’ clues above, we set ourselves up for a virtuous cycle of human development. Individual flourishing begets and enables community flourishing and vice versa. We drop into the richness of an infinite game of lifting ourselves and each other up. Human development is a worthwhile societal goal to attach ourselves to rather than the defacto societal goal of mindless economic growth in the dominant paradigm. Infinite growth is possible in the open system of human development, unlike the practically closed physical systems we exist within. This goal is at the center of Freinacht’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36107916-the-listening-society&quot;&gt;The Listening Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of flourishing extends to ecology and to the rest of humanity; we need it to extend to our inner/outer work, and to our relationship to the land. This pursuit must extend solidarity to all of those around us, and prompt the question of how can our flourishing enable the flourishing of those outside of community. I liked what &lt;a href=&quot;https://jimruttshow.blubrry.net/daniel-christian-wahl-2/&quot;&gt;Daniel Christian Wahl mused to Jim Rutt recently&lt;/a&gt;, that we need community to be the yogurt culture that turns the surrounding milk to yogurt. And to break that metaphor a little, the replicating of that yogurt culture should not be homogenous; we should be trying to support others in flourishing in their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The conversation begins…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the six clues for transformational community that sit with me for now. They do not exist in a vacuum of considered purity; they are falling out of the conversations, observations and thinking that are happening all around me and my relations. If these clues are to make sense, they will have to be taken up by others and embodied, lived. Speaking to my own journey of considering these clues, they fell out of a yearning for a simple creed, a creed that was accessible to all seeking transformation, binding us in common purpose, whatever our different lineages. Just so you can see another moment of this journey, I first journaled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the simple creed&lt;br&gt;
a wide gate for us to pass through&lt;br&gt;
a simple, common foundation for us to build on&lt;br&gt;
seeing our heritage&lt;br&gt;
recognising the divine, the mystery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yearning for this creed still entices me, and these clues are not it. What I first wrote is an incomplete fragment and what it inspired in this writing is far, far too verbose. Perhaps others will come after all this and find the poetry that so alludes me.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To close, I will surface two questions that continue to rummage about in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why does this continue to feel so ridiculous?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aspiration is for something madly heroic; do we dare to dream of building a new culture out of the ruins of the old? The gambit we face is the attempt to respectfully tell our ancestors, “No, that is not the way”, to lovingly take the scalpel, the chisel and hammer to what they built and to reforge something new in its place. And, to leave a culture more easily worked by the hands and the hearts of those that come after us. Audacious, somewhat mad but ultimately, that is what I think and feel that we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How will we know it was all worthwhile?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ideal case: &lt;em&gt;we won’t&lt;/em&gt;. Obvious failure is easy enough to see. If we form communities, and they fall to pieces early on, we’ll know that wasn’t it. An inherent aspect of ‘going the distance’ for transformational community is that the culture surpasses us. Building transformational community could be decades of experimenting, living and learning; and maybe, despite our best efforts and thinking, we will create something that does not have juice for the long-term. My hope is that some of us, amongst all the divergent and different fellow travellers out there, will find paths forwards, even if the path my community takes loops us back or fades. We chase big bright dreams, ones we might not truly experience in our life-time, and live in the humility that we may be going about it all back to front. This is surely part of the inner work we must do to keep ourselves true to our dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

Pile in with opinions as you like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Brief context:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2001 Ford E350 Econoline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probably converted to SMB in 2002/2003 (1st owner)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Original setup detailed in the owners manual: engine battery + engine alternator + engine inverter, house battery (thermoil 1427), house inverter with Trace Engineering RC6 panel, house generator slung under van. Fridge, water pump, microwave, Starcool house AC (not that we use it), house lights, 12v outlets, US plug outlets etc on house power/battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1st owner added solar panel, connected to Kyocera Commander IV unit, I assume after initial build (no details in owners manual)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd owner switched in LED lights across house to limit power draw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd owner has also replaced battery at least once. Not sure what brand but assuming typical 200 amp hour RV battery (Deka or … LifeLong?? Whats the other common one?). The house battery is slung under the barn doors. Its a unit; best removed with a jack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me, 3rd owner, still figuring out what each of these system components does and represents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engine battery voltage has always been strong, from the dash readout. Maybe up to 14v or 15v? It reliably charges the house battery, acknowledging that this charging can be slower if things like the van AC are running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when received in March 2020, the battery seemed solid and the solar panel was pushing about 2 solar amps into the system on a good day (best I ever saw was 2.5 solar amps; its a fairly old panel and its small).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;sup&gt;The Graceful Tripper&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Issues&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, now I suspect at possibly three issues at play:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fault between panel and Kyocera; Now the Kyocera shows 0 solar amps at all times&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;battery misbehaving; doesn’t seem to hold much charge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;House inverter misbehaving; I can get charge into the battery when the engine is running but not when the generator is running&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our first small trips, we weren’t consciously managing power or thinking too hard about how much driving we were doing. Between the solar panel, driving, and messing around with the generator, we weren’t really paying attention to battery levels. I have memories of the Kyocera and the RC6 reading the battery voltage as high as 13 or 13.5ish &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; I can’t recall whether we were running the engine or generator at the time (which would then we telling us about the voltage output of the engine/gen-set, not the battery)
We have just returned from a longer trip (4 weeks roughly), and this is where these issues started to bubble up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, we went backpacking for four days and three nights in the middle Sierras (at the very start of the trip). I wanted to test whether the battery would last that long, keeping the fridge on. The idea of a reheated curry at the trailhead was certainly enticing! Unfortunately, it didn’t last and we lost the curry. :(
But after that, I started to notice some of these issues with the house battery. I was working under the assumption that the inverter would protect the house battery from load when it got too low (as described in the owner manual) but perhaps that was incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Rae Lakes Loop&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Discovering that something was up&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the backpacking, we drove 6 hours home and after a few days at home (getting our motorcycle carrier setup), we also drove another 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second week of the trip, we parked the van near Mt Shasta for several days and I noticed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The generator would not charge the house battery, only the engine (I had assumed the generator did charge the battery). The generator would still power the house appliances though (microwave being the very obvious example)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In fact, the RC6 unit lights for bulk or float charge never come on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solar panel was no longer showing any solar amps coming out of it what so ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a day, the battery couldn’t keep the fridge on overnight (despite running the engine and generator for over an hour to recharge it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Trace RC6 unit while the engine is running&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;The journey continued&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got smoked out of Shasta and headed for the Oregon coast (This was mainly a PNW trip). As we bumped up towards North Washington, we had several days with different hours of driving, and I started taking notes about what voltage was coming out of the battery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a longer day of driving (the 23rd), the battery voltage seemed to top out at 12 volts. The next morning (24th), the fridge had dropped it to 9.3. We drove less than 2 hours on the 24th, and the next morning (25th), we only had 7.9 volts and the fridge wasn’t running. On the 26th we drove over four hours, getting the battery to 12 volts at the end of the day and it fell to 7.3 by the next morning (on this morning the RC6 was also flashing strangely… I assume an error code that isn’t listed in the owners manual)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, we arrived at a relative’s house in Washington, cleared out the fridge and turned it off for a week, with a bunch of driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last week back, we drove more per day, so avoided the fridge conking out. At this point, we were dodging the wildfires in Oregon that were coming up everywhere, and making tracks home to Northern California. The voltage at the end of all that driving (including over 9 hours on the last day) got up to 12.2 volts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;What is a healthy voltage range coming out of house battery? I was expecting over 13 volts for a full charge. The RC6 manual states: “A completely dead battery will read about 11.6 volts or less in an at-rest position”. So I suspect something is funky there for sure…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I expect the generator to charge the house battery?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should one expect a correctly functioning inverter from discharging a house battery to a level that damages it? Again, the RC6 manual states that it ought to do this. But if the inverter is partially busted, perhaps some of its features aren’t working.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could there be a blown fuse between solar panel and Kyocera commander? Or just a bad wire?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Possible actions to take&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, there is a mix of a few different issues here and I need to figure out how to resolve them.
Some options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain the battery (check fluid level etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the battery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switch battery to DIY lithium battery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace inverter?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upgrade solar panel (I want a bigger panel)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Maintain or Replace battery&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No change to the power setup here; just fixing or replacing stuff. Either way, I would need to figure out how to access the battery. Considering its bulk and position, I would need a hand (or a flat jack) and also I haven’t figured out how to remove the battery from its carry cage under the van. Any links to youtube videos of someone doing that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Switch to lithium&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A friend in Washington has set up their own bespoke lithium setup for their overlanding rig. Getting 2nd hand cells, testing them all, throwing them into a purpose built case and away you go. Well, of course there are important differences between the AGM and lithium batteries (AC/DC stuff I’m not fully aware of) and I suspect I will have to  make changes to the inverter (but if the current one is already busted…)
Feels like a high effort, high risk, high reward possibility…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Replace the inverter&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the weird behavior, and the corrosion on the POWER SWITCH (is that the inverter?), I suspect something needs to be sorted on the inverter. Since the generator can still run the appliances but seemingly not charge the battery, I would guess there is a break in the circuit between inverter and house battery. But then how is the fridge pulling volts from the house battery? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Corrosion on the power switch&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Upgrade the solar panel&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve been wanting to do this since before there were these power issues. I’m not sure whether I’ll have to update the Kyocera Commander unit as well; the ideal would just be taking off the old panel, mounting the new ones on the roof tracks and plugging in new panel(s). However I have a vague recollection that the control unit can also have a big impact on what power you can get out of panels, so an update might be needed anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s basically where I am at today. Air quality is insanely bad outside right now, so I doubt I’m going to get to any of this on the weekend but I would love to hear from folks about what gaps I have in my understanding or plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, hardly unexpected in these times but here it is; Fork-in-the-path COVID19 April edition. This is an example of the scenario mapping exercise, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/2020/forkinpath/&quot;&gt;fork-in-the-path&lt;/a&gt;, that I described earlier this week. This is going to be pretty raw, bulky and not super edited but I want to ‘publish’ it now as a snapshot of my sense-making in this period. The process has already illuminated some big assumptions and assertions for me, that I have already got to research and add more defined shape to my sense-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a look behind what could go into a vetted and extensively polished piece.  This is long and sprawling by nature. Please excuse the mess ;)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; A quick glossary before we get rolling:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the dance (from &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56&quot;&gt;the hammer and the dance&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a huge shutdown (the hammer) to drop the infection rate per infection (R0) to below 1, regions can consider lifting restrictions to some extent, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/upshot/coronavirus-four-benchmarks-reopening.html&quot;&gt;while still trying to keep R0 under 1.&lt;/a&gt; This is the dance. If they mess up, infections spike and another shelter-in-place/lockdown is necessary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;test-and-trace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A catch-all name for the public health tracking of infections and testing of the population for the virus. One of the main tools needed for ‘the dance’ and to avoid huge shutdowns&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;corona-hell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A state where a community’s health-care system is close to being overwhelmed, or is overwhelmed by covid19 related case-loads. The rate of fatality increases dramatically. Several population centers around the world have already experienced periods of this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PPE; Personal protection equipment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://laist.com/latest/post/20200407/governor-newsom-california-rainy-day-fund-depleted&quot;&gt;California Rainy Day fund&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LA_92_%28film%29&quot;&gt;Riots of ‘92&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the guidelines of fork-in-the-path:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;“First, identify the interleaving time chunks you want to focus on”&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time chunks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April/May&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June/July/August&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sep/Oct/Nov/Dec&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 1/Question 2 Next year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;“Second, identify the interleaving scopes, often as questions”&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question 1: &lt;strong&gt;How does the USA intersect with covid19?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question 2: &lt;strong&gt;How does the USA respond in the political/economic realm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question 3: &lt;strong&gt;What is happening globally?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Question 4: &lt;strong&gt;How does the bay and California fare through this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Since I am currently in the USA, specifically the Californian Bay Area, most of the questions tie into each other through this geographic connection. Also, it helped me to answer the most localized question last, after considering how wider scale situations might play out.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;“Third, map the time chunks to the questions and just start vibing on them”&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question 1: How does the USA intersect with covid19&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April/May for Question 1 (USA x Covid19)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Branching decision: no major branch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several locations in the USA hit corona-hell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;there will be periods where thousands (plural) perish nationally every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small number of areas ease back some types of restrictions and try to enter the ‘dance’ phase the hammer and the dance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Viral load testing and test processing picks up, cases continue to climb&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PPE scramble continues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PPE and equipment mass spamming picks up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waves of medical staff infected and/or burnt out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Staffing for test-and-trace efforts need to be spun up now, else we’ll be unable to effectively lift restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-body testing begins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does this spin off into a certification process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;happy branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First wave peters out with successful shelter-in-place&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test-and-trace, plus minimal restrictions are sufficient to keep R0 under 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatalities drop to just hundreds per day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;median branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PPE scramble wanes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing capacity levels off; agility still hugely required, as testing supply-chain stocks continue to be a risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Dr. Gottlieb and colleagues estimate that the nation would need to have the capacity to run 750,000 tests a week
— this is after things have calmed down greatly. There are times &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/we-need-1-million-tests-week/609154/&quot;&gt;we might need even more&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am concerned the USA might not maintain that level of testing (we currently are at that level but since we are in the depth of the pandemic, we need a higher testing capacity until we get things under control.). The Federal government is cutting funding to their testing efforts 2020/4/10 (and then reinstated the funding at the last moment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earliest chance for roll out of non-vaccine pharmaceutical interventions (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/04/what-coronavirus-drug-will-look-like/609661/&quot;&gt;existing drugs&lt;/a&gt; that we can verify as effective treatment). &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jbrafel/status/1247058257341972482&quot;&gt;Many trials are currently underway.&lt;/a&gt; Hard to determine what the likelihood that something will be worthwhile but we should know with some certainty by July or August&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medical staff becomes the main bottleneck for full-care&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;April/May hotspots will cool down but then face hard choices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open restrictions and risk immediate second wave?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can level of medical care be sustained?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic and social pressures to open things up…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The challenge will be finding a way to balance keeping the R0 (infection rate per infection) under 1 while trying to open things back up as much as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple areas that were slow to put non-medical interventions in place in March/April (shelter-in-place, lockdown etc) now become the hardest hit areas. Some will luck out and escape corona-hell but others will be pounded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If mass movement is still possible across the country, any areas trying to go into the dance phase will either have to restrict inter-area travel or face increased risk of secondary waves. If test-and-trace staffing was built up in April/May, some areas will be able to continue with only partial restrictions the dance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events of more than 50 people will increase risk of super-spreading outbreaks: Several large public events (sporting matches, festivals, street parades, choir practice) have been identified as super-spreading events in the past, and I expect this to be a constant risk until herd-immunity is achieved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During this period, we will be many days where thousands will perish and I expect some rough instances where the USA has five-figure days for fatalities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sep/Oct/Nov/Dec for Question 1 (USA x Covid19)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;happy branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mass scale pharmaceutic intervention comes into play; it is freely available and cheap/subsided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We probably only have to deal with an economic recession, instead of a full-blown depression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The election might even be ‘normal’ by 2016 standards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatalities drop to just dozens a day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;median branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fatalities per day drop to just thousands nationally&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing capacity stabilizes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With regional movement restrictions in place, test-and-trace is more feasible. Ideally many areas have entered into the #dance phase. This is still dependent on staffing for this effort being spun up and sustained in the priors prior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical staffing continues to be challenge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various areas and medical individuals trade-off the risks of helping ‘fight the virus’ in other areas, versus the risk to themselves and their area’s capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nasty branch: failure to test-and-trace on wide scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this scenario, we get worse outcomes medically, more locations hitting corona-hell, and follow up ways of infection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amongst this chaos, we try to do an election. Yikes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nasty branch: virus levels up edition: 1918 flu redux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is VERY unlikely to occur, due to differences in how corona viruses mutate, when compared to influenza viruses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It gets worse, higher fatality level, particularly of younger cohorts. Mutual aid is limited, social distancing will not be enough. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government and societal structures are overwhelmed. Small scale community is the most reliable ‘state’ actor. The beginning of the #longest-winter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nasty branch: socio-economic edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I expect there will be more stimulus by this point. I can’t determine what state the economy will be in by this stage. This nasty branch assumes it has gone poorly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;economic resources and governance deteriorates to the point where it heavily impacts different regions ability to sustain the common-wealth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rationing in place; baseline health is lower, so virus more deadly; more desperation-breakages of quarantine ==&gt; more outbreaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quarter 1/Quarter 2, 2021 for Question 1 (USA x Covid19)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;happy branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a mix of effective restrictions, test-and-trace and a noticeable increase in coordination between the different levels of government, We don’t see another sustained outbreak across the USA and the death toll is well under 100,000.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now to deal with that recession!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;median branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earliest possible that a viable vaccine is widely released (from April onward in super lucky scenario, probably later in the year)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end of the medical crisis is nigh in the USA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nasty economy branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;End of medical crisis dragged out by lack of resources, particularly if access to vaccine or antivirals is constrained&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nasty virus branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is VERY unlikely to occur, due to differences in how corona viruses mutate, when compared to influenza viruses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vaccine only blocks old strains&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get stuck in successive waves of this shit, it becomes an extra chronic disease like the flu&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question 2: How does the USA respond in the political/economic realm?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April/May for Question 2 (USA political/economic shifts)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued ineffective coordination between Federal and State level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unemployment number GROWTH continues to spike, but then levels off in May (first wave will be roughest but secondary waves won’t hit yet).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As of 2020/04/10, unemployment claims include about 10% of the entire USA workforce. Hard to determine a ceiling for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June/July/August Next year for Question 2 (USA political/economic shifts)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subsequent unemployment number growth waves show up, while some sections of economy try to return to ‘normal’. Choppy employment dynamics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the economy even look like? Food supply chain, logistics, remote tech, essentials and an increasing inability for companies/people to pay for things. Do we have more nuanced concepts of ‘essential’ work/industry?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming we are past the peak in May, collective grieving, echoed through social media, will drive us to the brink. Social media will go from a distraction to a nightmare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Federal instigation of travel restrictions in areas?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;States blocking transit/travel from certain areas?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sep/Oct/Nov/Dec for Question 2 (USA political/economic shifts)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Election is a hot mess; fight over default for mail-in ballots, huge amounts of disinformation, lack of trust in the process increases. If we thought 2016 was contentious…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unemployment will still be high, even if covid is under control, worse and weirder if not under control. Choppy employment dynamics continue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional stimulus might be ‘needed’ and might fuck with the marco-economics of the USA: inflation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective messaging would deliver this election to the democrats but they will still struggle to win the senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trump may play silly buggers regardless and try to delay a transition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nasty branch: virus levels up edition: 1918 flu redux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is VERY unlikely to occur, due to differences in how corona viruses mutate, when compared to influenza viruses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government and societal structures are overwhelmed. Small scale community is the most reliable ‘state’ actor. The beginning of the #longest-winter in the collective living memory of humanity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wide scale restrictions on movement, being enforced ‘socially’ or by non-government actors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nasty branch: socio-economic edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;economic resources and governance deteriorates to the point where it heavily impacts different regions ability to sustain the common-wealth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rationing in place; baseline health is lower, so virus more deadly; more desperation-breakages of quarantine ==&gt; more outbreaks&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quarter 1/Quarter 2, 2021 for Question 2 (USA political/economic shifts)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;median branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Earliest possible that a viable vaccine is widely released&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critical moment in history: how does USA society respond in this new age? Does it tear parts of the USA apart? Does it accelerate social movements for universal health coverage and other worker rights? Do corporatist elements manage to make bank at the expense of workers/citizens through a crisis again? Does the USA go full scale totalitarian or fascist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pretty hard to pick at this point :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At a minimum, economic depression will be a real challenge; not just in the ‘stonks’ way but in very tangible to peeps way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lifestyle patterns will be shifted. Folks will reprioritize their life, in a jumble of ways. This will be a year of great change. Whole industries will have been reshaped from what they looked like 18 months before.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nasty branch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If things go really really pear-shaped, either through wide-scale economic collapse or overwhelming contagion and fatality…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;USA society will have to completely recast its relationship to death, community, stability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unfathomable how this would play out.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wide scale community contagion across most population centers of the world that haven’t already braced for impact or been hit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-industrialized countries introduce even more restrictive measures to limit contagion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;China makes huge soft power plays by stepping into many communities outside of China that are impacted by covid19&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global food insecurity risk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nations start building/hoarding their grain stockpiles, spiking prices&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sep/Oct/Nov/Dec for Question 3 (Global picture)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several governments collapse under the pressure of juggling the choice between mass restrictions and mass outbreaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A select number of states that managed the pandemic response well and/or have easily policed borders manage to return to something akin to normalcy in regards to restrictions. Now they just have to adjust to economic headwinds and the weirdness that abounds in global trade and travel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slightly higher than background chance of regional conflicts breaking out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global travel and trade is a mess&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quarter 1/Quarter 2, 2021 for Question 3 (Global picture)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global power is reshaped rapidly; If China managed to contain its own outbreaks, it spends 2020 taking huge international role while USA and EU focus inwards on their own outbreaks. Consequences of that start to show up in 2021&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global depression continues (we don’t hit a true bottom until months after vaccine is ubiquitous)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global travel and trade continues to be a mess, but now with some recovery, probably limited to countries that have the virus contained. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Political unrest, at minimum on the scale of the Arab Spring (which also fed into Syrian conflict and then into refugee crises), will be kicking off through out this period, fueled by economic/food hardship.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By the end of this period we start getting more realistic statistics for global deaths related to covid19 for 2020&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Question 4: How does the bay and California fare through this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April/May for Question 4 (California and Bay perspective)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bay overcomes its first wave of covid19 without its health-care system being overwhelmed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shelter-in-place (SIP) will be continued past May 1. If adequate test-and-trace measures are in place, California will start lifting restrictions in May. However, as of 2020/04/11, this looks unlikely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;California and other states are now (as of 2020/04/07) organizing to buy PPE and supplies as a buying block, ensuring cheaper and more equitable distribution of supplies. This effectively sees them performing an action normally done by the federal government… could there be more coordination like this? #succession&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see some really nasty waves hit across the USA and might hold shelter-in-place longer than we would have otherwise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given the current numbers in the Bay, we could have been out of shelter-in-place by early to mid May but will likely hold it longer longer because of State gov restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will probably still be a range of restriction tho… what would that look like? Maybe it is just easier to stick with shelter-in-place?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June/July/August Next year for Question 4 (California and Bay perspective)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;California’s rainy day fund will still be going strong, providing coverage for unemployment and essential services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first shelter-in-place will have done its job; California will probably no longer have a testing backlog. The healthcare system will be still operating, although depending on how the peak goes in April/May burn-out will start to show in staff, unless this is proactively mitigated in some way. As of 2020/04/11, I am feeling more optimistic about this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still unlikely that large events (anything over 50 peeps) will be sensible to hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serology (antibody) testing will become widely available; perhaps certification of those who are ‘immune’ will allow them to return to work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test-and-trace infrastructure will be getting up to speed in San Francisco and perhaps other urban parts of CA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Housing and rent become huge political issues in the cities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don’t think the first shelter-in-place (March/April edition) will be held in place until this point. California will attempt to dance. The challenge will be how to handle intra-USA movements into the state, from infected areas, and how quickly can we jump on outbreaks. This depends on whether tests per day capacity is sufficient (for USA 750,000 was the reference number), whether sufficient public health monitoring is in place and whether folks have signed up to the mobile phone tracking programs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another factor is how much California (particularly health-care workers) will be able to help other USA regions that are in corona-hell, and whether this strains Californian capability. (As of 2020/04/11, according to Bob Wachter, chair of UCSF medicine, UCSF medics are already heading for NYC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public mask wearing becomes common but not the standard; many refuse unless shelter-in-place level of restrictions are in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the dance begins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you try to restart your business during this time? Economic recovery is slow and stuttery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If California can restrict the open movement of people into the state, AND it has built up sufficient test-and-trace capacity, it will have a good chance of holding in a test-and-trace pattern&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it does not (or cannot) slow/quarantine or ban that flow, it will struggle to perform test-and-trace, and will likely need to add another shelter-in-place order, shutting the state down again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;&lt;strong&gt;shelter-in-place held&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the low likelihood that the first shelter-in-place is held:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’ll see folks going nuts… it’ll be months of shelter-in-place by then&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social unnnnrest!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Economic chaos; the tech/non-tech divide will become more and more stark&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still unlikely that large events (anything over 50 peeps) will be sensible to hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;California will have likely built up sufficient capacity for test-and-trace by this point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious risk of another outbreak in California during this time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mainly depends on the condition of the health-care system and success of test-and-trace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And whether there is free movement between areas where the virus is contained and areas where it is not?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;colder weather forces us closer together?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Folks and governments getting lax?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voting, polling, electioneering stuff?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quarter 1/Quarter 2, 2021 for Question 4 (California and Bay perspective)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuation of test-and-trace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Still unlikely that large events (anything over 50 peeps) will be sensible to hold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Californian state budget is borked (pretty much a given as of 4/2020); expect huge cuts to services, infrastructure is not maintained, gov services continue to be shitful and strained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rainy-day fund will be exhausted; State capacity will decrease significantly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unless virus mutates into something worse (very unlikely), California probably limps out of this period relatively well off health wise but in tricky economic situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Four, scan, vet and backfill&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This step was done but its all included in the commentary above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Five: Profit!&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is certainly volume over quality but the wide canvassing has helped me flesh out some implicit assumptions and other patterns of my thinking. I’ll throw a few of those in at the end here but each of these could be worth researching and unpacking in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take aways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My pessimism about federal and state coordination really undercuts many of the measures I think are necessary to deal with the challenge in the USA. There is strong evidence for this is causing problems already and I would not expect coordination to improve substantially for the time-being.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collectively the USA isn’t doing the test-and-trace legwork it needs to do today, to responsibly reopen parts of the country in the future;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USA needs the vaccine as its back-stop, before things can return to ‘normal’; This is a big claim and one worth a deep dive (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/DeItaOne/status/1248272555452108802?s=09&quot;&gt;It is what Canada seems to be working off&lt;/a&gt;). We are at best &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cell.com/immunity/pdf/S1074-7613(20)30120-5.pdf?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1074761320301205%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&quot;&gt;12-18 months away from one of the many vaccine efforts getting widespread adoption&lt;/a&gt;. In essence, it is my view that the USA will struggle to consistently coordinate test-and-trace and appropriate movement restrictions to get things ‘under control’ before vaccines are likely to arrive in 2021. This happened because of #1 &amp;#x26; #2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We will be in a recession, if we are lucky. Economic depression is more likely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Events and large gatherings are done for the next 12-18 months; They will be reckless in the USA until herd-immunity. Which will depend on #3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enduring strain and shocks on food supply chain; how will the supply system cope? Very hard for me to gauge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be some forms of restrictions until herd immunity/vaccine is reached; Because of #3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One step closer to chaos (background risks of other issues/disasters remains the same; but now they hit when we are even less able to deal with them). Riots of ‘92 are an example (from thirty years ago) of how social unrest back get messy fast, even in the USA. This is a result of #4, #6, #7 and the general backdrop of chronic national emergency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t try to read trends in the data on a day-by-day basis (week to week is probably more reliable)&lt;/li&gt;

Sometimes it is really worth the time to map out the ways you are making sense of a situation, to tease out the nuance, the gaps, the relationships and the key factors in how things might unfold. Fork-in-the-path is my attempt at structuring that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the fork-in-the-path is to identify some big questions you have about a handful of key interleaving issues and map out how they will shift over time.
These issues could span from the personal, household-level, community, state/province, nation-state, region, global and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It is a thought-exercise, best conducted with a sprinkle of forecasting, some risk and impact assessments and some poetic license. You are mapping out your sense-making space, hopefully in a way that will help you uncover gaps in your thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: Trying out an explicit scenario building exercise, roughly influenced by my dubious professional past in the intelligence community and recent hobby forecasting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;First, identify the interleaving scopes, often as questions&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The different questions do need to have some relationship to one another. Otherwise, why include them in the same exercise? For example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens with X during this time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the relationship between X and Y shift?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is happening in the wider region that X and Y are operating?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Second, identify the time chunks you want to focus on&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These chunks should be different sizes: the further away from now they represent, the larger the chunk. This is a built-in hedge against the reality that projections of how things might go in the future are more susceptible to chaos.
For example, building out a fork-in-the-path at the start of April:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April/May&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June/July/August&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sep/Oct/Nov/Dec&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1/Q2 Next year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chunks are imprecise, they are a little messy. The boundaries between them are defined but events/phenomena we are projecting can cross those boundaries with ease. Don’t get too worked up on the details for now.  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Third, map the time chunks to the questions&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just start vibing on them. Punch out assertions and possible forks first, don’t (yet) stress about linking them to references etc.
It is easy to get bogged down or side-tracked; just keep throwing assertions under the different time chunks for a question. If you are slowing down because you are hitting big cleaves in your thinking “But things could looks really different if this key situation changes”, then:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a median branch (the default branch)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a sub-branch for under that same time chunk with a catchy name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the assertions specific to that scenario&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, if you aren’t hitting branches in your different time chunks, especially those further away(should be more common the further you are projecting into the future), you should really question that: Am I too confident in my rough narrative for how things will go? &lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Fourth, scan, vet and backfill&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If time allows it, give yourself a few days to come back to this part with fresh eyes. After your frenzied assertion writing and scenario wilding, we need to make time to slow down and pick things apart. Did I comment on a facet in one place but it is missing elsewhere (don’t fall into the trap of feeling like you have to touch on EVERY topic in every time chunk)? Are there key assertions that one should question or research? Are there easy links or references to add to source material?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Fifth: Profit!&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve just created a snapshot of your sense-making! This is its own separate process that you can then plug into something else you are doing or want to do. What are some ways you can build off this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reflection and learning;&lt;/strong&gt; treat this like a particularly structured journal piece. Come back to it and reflect on how your sense-making in the past didn’t end up making sense or really did! Remember, we can only make sense of the world with the views and information we hold at the time, be gentle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting question generation;&lt;/strong&gt; Generate sets of forecasting questions that are related to these interleaving domains but that are targeted, somewhat measurable and time specific. Then you can run your own forecasting exercise (I know everyone’s dream, right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make decisions based on your sense-making;&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t forget, you are defacto doing this anyway ;) If you are considering big decisions, best to add some rigor to all this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Key assertions need extra attention, try to reference/vet all of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a few forecasts for each time-chunk, to keep you honest as time progresses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify how your decision making would be impacted by different branching through the time-chunks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out what decisions you might need to make, and how changes in conditions will make them necessary, redundant or otherwise influence them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If any of these decisions require some legwork or preparation, include that in your writeup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I’ll have a real-life example to show off shortly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shakshuka dish is inspired by a meal prepared by an Israeli friend, in a hostel in Cali, Colombia, in 2013. It was to celebrate Jewish New Year. While shakshuka is popular in Israel (as variations of it are across the Mediterranean), the dish isn’t particularly associated with the Jewish New Year as far as I am aware. If I recall correctly, the dish originated in Algeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally the dish is a breakfasty thing; one or two eggs poached in a tomato-based stew/sauce. This version is a bulk version, that I happily eat at all times of the day. It is nutritious, affordable, tasty and easy to make. The process doesn’t demand much precise or razor-focus, except for the ten-minute period at the end when the eggs are added. You can munch on it by itself or serve with a cereal, bread or toast. Couscous is a classic accompaniment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rough recipe list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a big eggplant (or two small)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a big onion (or two small)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a few fresh tomatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a big can of diced/cubed tomatoes (or two regular)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;seasoning (I use salt, pepper, and some combination of paprika, chilli powder, garlic and friends, depending on my mood)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cooking oil (I use good olive oil or coconut oil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I like to add some balsamic vinegar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A pot or pan that is more wide than deep, with a lid, and ideally a lid you can see through.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, critically: however many eggs you can/want to fit into the top of the pot/pan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a favored 12-inch/30-cm wide pan, with a glass lid, that can take 18-20 eggs no problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three main phases to this dish:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fresh veg dice and cook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding the tomatoes and stewing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adding the eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Fresh veg&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key here is to get the veggies in, to not overfill the pan/pot and not burn anything. So you don’t want the heat too high or to forgot to stir the pan/pot while you are doing other things. To begin, I dice the onion, bring the pan to a steady medium heat, and put them in with an initial amount of the cooking oil I am using. While they are cooking a bit, I dice the eggplant and then add them with more oil; the eggplant soak up the oil really nicely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the eggplant are in, I start adding seasoning to taste. Keep stirring through-out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Tomato time&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal here is to get the tomatoes in there, stewing and to reduce of moisture from the dish, to really bring out the flavors. Dice any fresh tomatoes and then add all the tomatoes into the pan/pot. Stir through, add more seasoning to taste (don’t be afraid to really layer it in there). The longer you can let this simmer, gently bubbling away, with moisture steaming off, the richer the dish will taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Egg time&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are ready for the eggs, you must switch to high-precision cooking mode. The critical aspect here is that eggs quickly get rubbery and tasteless when overcooked. Additionally, if you are adding 18 eggs to a dish, there could be a big difference in how the first and last eggs are cooked. I used to go on a mad egg cracking spree, hectically cracking the egg individually and putting them into the pot/pan one by one. But recently I have found a more consistent method. I crack them all into a separate bowl while the tomatoes are stewing, and then gently pour all 18 of them out into the pan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the eggs are in the stew/sauce, I put a timer on for 7 minutes. With a clear lid, you can see the whites of the eggs slowly change from translucent to opaque white. At around seven minutes, the eggs will be really close to being ready. Since the eggs will continue to cook a little once they get taken off the heat, you have to make a judgement call on when they are &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; cooked to your preference. For me, that is when the whites are mostly opaque but they are still roughly 20% translucent. At that point, I remove from the heat, let it settle for a few minutes and then serve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dish is great served with your choice of cereal or bread. It is easy to reheat for later serves (although be careful not to overcook the egg on the second time around!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean when I say I’m witch-adjacent? Or NFL-adjacent? Or that I live in a Christian-adjacent society. Well, simply, it means I am near those things (adjacent to them), and I am impacted by them whether or not I identify with them. If I did identify strongly with them, I’d say things like “I’m a witchy-boi”, “I’m pumped for this Superbowl matchup” or “Jesus is the reason for the season”. But often we are adjacent to things that we don’t strongly identify with. And while our sense-making is obviously impacted by our primary interests and identities, these adjacent secondary and tertiary aspects of our communities seep into and impact our lives. I have been thinking about this recently as a way of reflecting on my relationship to different communities I am a part of, and also pondering how adjacency impacts our sense of belonging in community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: Speculative. This piece is about both the ways I have seen ****-adjacent used in the wild and also how I have started using it in my thinking. If you know of academic or other writing that digs into what I am describing, please direct me that way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;What is an example of how I can apply the idea of adjacency?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started writing about adjacency over the last month, and was chuffed when an example of it just popped up in a conversation last week. I was visiting Berlin for the first time, and catching up with an old acquaintance, Danny*, who had moved there two years prior. He shared that he had really enjoyed getting deep into the salsa* community in Berlin, went to salsa events across Europe and even was teaching classes but that despite obviously sharing an interest in salsa with the people in that community, he hadn’t really connected with folks from the community deeply. He felt like there wasn’t enough connective overlap of other interests in the community that he shared, and was curious if the dance/movement events I had gone to in my Berlin week would be a more fruitful in this regard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;* not their real name, nor the relevant dance community&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had intuitively described one of the key scenarios that had shaped my thinking about adjacency: how our choice (or circumstance) of different communities/interests can shape our sense of belonging and the quality of our connections with folks, depending on the adjacent qualities of that community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this instance, Danny was probably seeking a community that was more burner-adjacent or more personal-growth-adjacent, than the dance community he had invested in for two years. Equipped with the idea of adjacency, Danny will hopefully be able to more readily figure out if other movement communities will offer a better chance at deeper connection. How to navigate broad social investments as an individual is just one facet of how the idea of adjacency has been tumbling around in my head. The other main facet is the relevance of adjacency when one is trying to build a community; a facet that I will return to later. First I want to lay out some of the qualities or patterns I am linking to this concept of adjacency.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What are some of the qualities of adjacency?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communities have explicit or implicit primary affiliations of either geography, theme and/or social clique. Adjacency favors the other, secondary, qualities of a community.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adjacency is about what is near, in both a geographic and a network sense. In prior ages, ones neighbours and surrounding cultures were adjacent and influenced our communities and selves (yes, this is very obvious, bear with me). We might still have had strong network adjacency to trade partners, for example. With the modern density of cities and increased ways of being networked (easier to travel, internet connectivity, etc), network adjacency is more prominent in our lives. The people we know and the hobbies, workplaces and activities we travel to tend to have a bigger influence than the folks on our street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have seen some uses of adjacency (for example, a figure being described as socialist-adjacent), that imply that the figure views the stated adjacent quality positively. I do not want to confine adjacency to this narrow usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to have varying low-level stances on things we are adjacent to; acceptance, avoidance, rejection. At times these stances mount into something with more weight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consequently, adjacency is a great path towards openly embracing something, if we come to like or accept it. However it can also feel imposing or suffocating. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example, in the USA, queer folk as a cohort have been becoming more public about their queer identity over the last few decades. More communities and places are becoming queer-adjacent in some form. This has increased the perceived adjacency of queerness across the population, and has overall led to a significant change in accepting attitudes towards queer-folk. Yes, this progress is real, and yes, there are still people that get upset about crossing rainbow patterned cross-walks. This tiny intrusion into their sense-making space is bringing obscured/latent homophobia in some communities to the surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The size and density of a community (what city, what suburb, what work, what community group, what household) tends to inversely scale with the strength or weakness of adjacent affiliations in that community. Just by being in Salt Lake City, I might be exposed to the Mormon faith (a gentle Mormon-adjacency) but my incidental exposure could shift dramatically based on more specific choices about neighbourhood, work place, community group, hobbies, etc, even if I never expressly factor Mormonism into my decision making process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally the volume of adjacent qualities in a community scales slightly super-linearly with its size and density. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right! Hopefully now you have a more fleshed out sense of what adjacency is. How can we use adjacency in our sense-making? I will delve into that question in tomorrow’s piece on using adjacency in our sense-making and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[My dream mobile workflow for Roam Research]]></title><description><![CDATA[What is Roam Research?

&lt;p&gt;Roam is a web application for note-taking, focusing on structuring one’s notes in a graph (a network, instead of in a hierarchy or linear log, the most common mainstream note taking structures). It makes this easy to jump into by starting with a “Daily Notes” section, and by encouraging easy bi-directional linking of topics and pages via hashtags and simple linking shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how I found out about it, aside from it coming from Twitter but Nate Eliason’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam&quot;&gt;“Roam: Why I love it and how I use it”&lt;/a&gt; piece was a big inflection point for me giving Roam a go. If you are doing any sort of writing, research or interested in knowledge management, I would give it a crack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am writing today to talk about how I &lt;em&gt;imagine&lt;/em&gt; I would like to use the mobile app, which is in the works for Roam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What would I want out of a mobile app?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily notes being available would be an MVP for me&lt;/strong&gt; And the ability to view my db, even if there isn’t &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt; a smooth way to update/edit (just my preconception of mobile, harder to do input). This would basically fill the use-case of wanting to be able to quickly put up references/notes on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;However, I anticipate note-taking from other sources on mobile to be tricky.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the moment, I can only meaningfully tackle my reading backlog on a desktop/laptop browser&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full figured reading, video watching or podcast listening in one screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2nd screen or fast gesture-flick to 2nd virtual desktop to write notes in roam research web app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is likely that replicating this workflow on mobile will be a disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No 2nd screen, and I have concerns about the clunkiness of switching back and forth on mobile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hotkeys and shortcuts on mobile? Oh boy… Even using # to tag will be a burden on most mobile ‘keyboards’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So, does one opt for a modified workflow?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assuming attention and screen time focused on the primary source (Often Pocket for me, Or twitter)…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My initial thought is integrating the “share” system functionality into a note-taking session&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitting this opens a system dialogue that allows one to select an app to share the snippet to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One would then hit Roam, with a conditional:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if there is an active note-session, the snippet is saved and the user is returned to the primary app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;if there is no active note-session, the user is dropped into the Roam app to activate a session, with the first snippet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe the system dialogue can allow multiple sharing options, so you have a ‘save’ action to press and a ‘edit/tag’ action for each of these workflows…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just like that, we would have taken a quick note in roam that requires minimal context switching&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Some further questions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would this flow work in the iOS context (for the sake of the Roam devs…)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the “share” system functionality include metadata about the source of the share that RoamResearch can make automated use of? Looking for ease of adding metadata to a note-taking session&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the concept of a “session” warrant inclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allows for some predefined tags to be dropped in but also adds overhead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we extend a note-taking “session” to recording audio and time stamping notes/photos?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do these note-sessions go into an optional queue for further processing/tagging or will it work fine just getting dumped into the bi-directional linking of one’s Roam graph?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is about the extent of my thoughts for the day on this. What sort of mobile workflows would suit your situation?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Initiation and Adulthood]]></title><description><![CDATA[Particularly over the last year, I have regularly revisited the ideas of ‘marking’ and ‘initiation’ in discussion with my youth group and…]]></description><link>https://twicefire.com/priors/initiation/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://twicefire.com/priors/initiation/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2019 17:11:55 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Particularly over the last year, I have regularly revisited the ideas of ‘marking’ and ‘initiation’ in discussion with my youth group and with others in my life. The frame of these discussions was almost always around the teenage context of the lads in the group. But recently, in part due to a wry comment from one of the youth, I have been thinking about the broader context of initiation, what it means to be initiated into adulthood and where is that initiation meant to lead us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/ritesofpassage/marking/&quot;&gt;marking ceremony&lt;/a&gt; last month, the group arrived at John Hinkel Park and we orientated them to the space. I explained to the boys that for the ceremony, we would have the youth or uninitiated on one side of the amphitheater and the adults (the implicit assumption being that they are ‘initiated’) would sit on the other side. One of the lads slyly commented at this point:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Dad should be sitting with us then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a chuckle across the group and I acknowledged the observation with a quick “That’s real, there are uninitiated adults out there” before moving on with our preparation. I would love to return to that comment with the group in time but for now, I want to explore the concepts of initiation and adulthood here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: Exploratory. This piece is a product of several discussions with folk and related reflections about my youth group, their recent rites of passage, and what it is to be initiated into adulthood. It draws from many conversations over several years, with folk working in the rites of passage space but (reader beware) I have not systematically researched and read up on academic fields related to adulthood or initiation (if these fields truly exist) for this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initiation via rites of passage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our rites of passage organization, Stepping Stones Project, makes a big deal out of initiation of youth into adulthood. The narrative of the organization includes the assertion that since industrialization/colonialism, many cultures have lost, had diminished or let go of the rites of passage that marked our coming-of-age life-stage, the transition from childhood to adulthood, and that this is undermining individual and communal flourishing. The organization’s program is an effort to return the primacy of coming-of-age rites of passage to contemporary society, initiating youth into the path towards full adulthood. So how common (or fair) was that lad’s observation that his father was ‘uninitiated’, since very very few of us have had a structured initiation in adulthood? I think his observation was fair, is ‘common’ across contemporary society, but that there are many many more ‘adults’ in the world than those who have undergone youth rites of passage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, I see rites of passage for youth as a positive contribution to but not a necessary condition for initiation into adulthood. Life can initiate us in its own way, over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping Stones seeks to provide structured, intentional and communal initiation of youth into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does an unstructured, unintentional, non-communal coming-of-age look like for youth? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unstructured; Without a pattern, a defined beginning or end. Even when contemporary society acknowledges the ‘coming of age’ period of our development, at best, structure is borrowed from other facets of teen life: school years, the cycle of summer holidays, birthdays, the age one can learn to drive or first work. Structure, when brought to rites of passage, creates a sense of something being built together, and a distinct history one can draw from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unintentional; Accidental, without thought, without awareness, going through the motions. This is common in contemporary times; How can one be intentional about creating a rite of passage when we don’t notice its absence? In circumstances where a community does have established rites of passage for youth, this is an area where they can still fall down; when the coming of age rites are practiced in a ‘going through the motions’ manner, without due care and attention to the mentorship of youth, this undermines the whole experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-communal; Singular, disconnected, alone, unwitnessed. An important part of individuation is understanding oneself in the context of community. It is a period of great change in our lives; being witnessed and seen in this transition is a powerfully connective experience for youth. Communal here should also mean the rite is shared with other youth, peers, and a common bond formed. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How might life initiate us without a rite of passage with these facets? Many societies do recognise the early teen years (~11-15) as a coming-of-age time, even if many industrialized ones also do not seem to have a handle on what to do about that. Any random child in our society will enter this phase of life and typically gets some sort of support but across a wide range of possible outcomes. Depending on their circumstances, youth will have (or not have) grand-parents, uncles and aunties, or teachers and coaches, that can offer some form of mentorship during this time. Similarly, religious community, schools, summer camps or other programs might offer formative experiences, with varying degrees of intentionally or structure about them being a ‘rite of passage’. This possible constellation of factors might be enough for some kids to be defacto ‘initiated’ but it is ultimately a roll of the dice, with mixed results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contemporary emphasis on the nuclear family hinders us here: youth individuate from their immediate families strongly at this time. After spending their entire existence completely submerged in the orbit of their parents, there is a something of a rejection and reexamination of what is ‘me’ and what is ‘you’, between youth and parents. Some youth could be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/well/family/why-teenagers-become-allergic-to-their-parents.html&quot;&gt;described as being ‘allergic’&lt;/a&gt; to their parents during this time. This shift in relating between youth and parents allows a critical role to be played by adult mentors during this coming-of-age period, a role that was commonly provided by ‘the village’, and prevalent in many societies over the full accounting of human history.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Self-initiation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The individuation process also drives youth to self-initiate; sensing the power adults have over them and the mysteries of adulthood, youth yearn to explore, be tested and proven. While it may not have the structure, intention or communal aspects of a full rite of passage process, self-initiation springs forth from the same developmental drive within us, and includes a similar initiatory pattern; leaving one’s comfort zone, going to the edge of our experience, returning and (ideally) reflecting on and noting the change in oneself. And, as long as we are pushing to better ourselves, we tend to continue pushing ourselves into initiatory experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk of adults today would have gone through this general initiatory pattern without a rite of passage process. This would largely have been with inconsistent support, with inconsistent witnessing by their community and often without the self-recognition that they are initiating themselves. Recently I facilitated a council with some adults, with the prompt “Returning to your teenage years, tell us one story about something that was a sort of an initiatory experience”. One man’s response detailed a long weekend, with several distinct episodes with his father, friends and solo adventure (involving themes of nature, getting drunk for the first time, running away and shoplifting!). He reflected on the truths, gratitude and awareness that had come to him over that long weekend but that this was the first time, as a father in his late 30s or early 40s, he had ever put together that all those experiences were an important initiation on his path towards adulthood. An extreme case but sometimes self-recognition and witnessing can still have a deep impact decades after. How many others of us are holding these moments from our lives, unwitnessed and unknown to our community?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between self-initiation and facilitated initiation can be wide. For one, youth and there peers tend not to have a good sense of their limits, and when combined with peer-pressure they can wildly exceed their boundaries. Our communities ought to be cultivating and channeling this ‘spark’ of self-growth via initiation, and resist the urge to smother it, an impulse one can readily find examples of throughout the history of different societies.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good initiatory experience &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; include a real edge; a challenge, a fear, a risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally it entails overcoming or exploring that edge, and with reflection and witnessing, learning about our relationship to that edge. Having someone trusted to facilitate provides a deeper initiatory experience &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; reduces the risk that an experience will take the youth too far beyond their limits. Self-initiatory experiences carry much greater risk of bad outcomes and anti-social behavior: Getting completely wasted in uncontrolled circumstances, petty crime, pranks that go beyond being “harmless”, violence, diving into sexual experiences too rapidly (not to suggest these should be facilitated per se!), reckless dare-devil behavior, bullying/hazing behavior, and more. In the very worse case scenarios, this can lead to harm and trauma, leaving youth with developmental scars that will not age away with time. While an understanding of the benefits of initiation are lost on many parents, the fear of negative outcomes from these risks is very present. This fear nicely fits in with the contemporary tendency to completely remove risk-taking from the lives of children and to structure out their days. Here we see a contemporary example of how societies can smother the spark of initiation in their youth. This eliminates ‘risk’ from a child’s life, for the guaranteed outcome of them being left unprepared for life and becoming disconnected from the initiatory spark that can drive personal growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other issues with the gap between self-initiation and facilitated initiation are much more subtle but equally pernicious. A facilitated initiation that integrates communal witnessing of youth helps build wider and stronger communal bonds, between the youth involved, between the youth and their direct family but also between the youth and the wider community, ‘the village’. Witnessing in this context is the gift of reflection and wisdom to the youth, a chance to give them a deeper perspective and learning about their initiatory experiences. Given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kdrum/status/1169667479272153089&quot;&gt;contemporary rise in ennui/listlessness, lack of purpose, alienation and disconnection&lt;/a&gt;, the lack of that communal bonding and witnessing is increasingly in need. While I frame an investment in coming-of-age rites of passage as something to address this, I do not see the absence of these rites as the sole cause of this sad trend. Broad societal trends tend to have many factors influencing them, and I am wary of any claims that a single factor is their source.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A model for full adulthood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my writing above, and in prior conversation and thinking, I have been brushing up against the concept of ‘adulthood’ without fully addressing it. Now is that time. &lt;em&gt;Lamentations about the unquantified prevalence of uninitiated adults in our society are common today.&lt;/em&gt; I frame much of the “Boomers vs Millennials” back &amp;#x26; forth as this. Here, each of those generations observes the other and readily finds short-comings in the uninitiated adults that are present in both (plus a good dose of the perennial “Kids these days!” flogging of the young generation). Luckily, both generations can be right! ;) At this point, we are generations deep into the uninitiated raising the uninitiated. While many &lt;a href=&quot;https://ourworldindata.org/12-key-metrics&quot;&gt;global metrics&lt;/a&gt; have improved over the last few centuries, the difficult-to-quantify ‘maturity’ of society is stagnant in comparison. Before I start getting at my concept of full adulthood, I want to address why this ‘uninitiated raising the uninitiated’ is a concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fear is, beyond the issues of alienation and disconnection raised earlier, that this leaves us brittle to collectively address the the challenges of living in a globalized humanity, including; global inequality, the resurgence of fundamentalist, reactionary and proto-fascist forces, and the ever-present climate challenge. This brittleness provides a wellspring of disenfranchised youth, particularly boys-in-men’s-bodies, for fundamentalists of all stripes to groom and recruit, and for reactionary figures to recruit in their call for a return to mythical past times of stability. While different in means and goals, both fundamentalists and reactionaries seek to drag us backward in time, typically seeking to reverse the victories of the civil rights movements of the 20th century, and otherwise deny society the opportunity to fully come to terms with, and liberate ourselves from, our histories of colonialism, slavery and inequality. These groups have demonstrated a better understanding of the power of belonging and initiation than most mainstream cultures, and thus, like street gangs, offer a way for young men to claim their manhood, even if it is ultimately in a self-destructive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Adulthood&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many qualitative ways for us to discuss and explore human maturation into adulthood; one of the reasons why legally we default to a simple, numeric, narrow and necessary definition of adult as someone who is 18 year old. It would be easy and foolish of me to point to a definition of full adulthood that was just a carbon-copy of my idealized concept of personhood. Clearly I have preferences but I am also trying to get at a form of adulthood that does not rely on my context or circumstances. Similarly, there are whole systems and models for human development that I do not want to bog you, the reader, and myself in, during this piece. I am seeking to get at the essence of full adulthood (which I frame as a subset of full person-hood), with the smallest descriptive area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four components of full adulthood that I keep returning to are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initiative&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Listening&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What serves?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Responsibility&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility is a fairly uncontested baseline attribute of adulthood. However, the question of “responsibility for what or whom” will bring diverse answers across different people, contexts and cultures. Not wishing to get bogged down in that, I just want to retain the feeling that we collectively have a sense that responsibility, in some form, is a component of adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Initiative&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the initiative, to act on the world around you. Are we making choices and decisions that we are being nudged into, or are we making our own narrative in life? This trait is the mature form of the impulse to self-initiate, and its antithesis is being passive in life or just reacting to the world around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Listening&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full adulthood entails a deep listening. A form of listening that comes from slowing down, clearing the mind of what ‘you are going to say’ or do next, and taking in the sounds, signals and signs around us. When one listens deeply, it is harder to be disconnected from the world around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;What serves?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What serves?” is short-hand for three questions, derived from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ojaifoundation.org/project/council-training/&quot;&gt;Ojai foundation’s council training&lt;/a&gt;: “What serves me?”, “What serves those around me?”, and “What serves the wider field/community/universe?“. Very few folk use those specific phrases/questions but someone who is deep into full adulthood is operating with the essence of what those questions are getting at; “What serves?“. The questions call the above components of listening, initiative and responsibility into relationship with the self, others and the universe; with an intention to find actions, words and efforts that genuinely serve all three scopes of the question.  When one can take the initiative to pause in a moment, ask the three variations, deeply listen for what is needed and take responsibility for a better path forward, that is an exemplar moment of what it is to step into full adulthood. It speaks to the realities that our ‘self’ is a complex multitude, emerging in the context of a socially constructed reality, set against the backdrop of the tangible truth of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What serves me?”, “What serves those around me?”, and “What serves the wider field/community/universe?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am holding on to the idea that there are folk out in the world that I disagree with significantly, and that hold very different values, that still fit this essential criteria of full adulthood. I have a sincere respect for these folk, even if I quibble with or outright reject some aspect of their prioritizing, actions or concepts. This respect comes from recognizing diversity in the way that folk are collectively working to better the world, recognizing their maturity, and how their context has shaped their own path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rounding back to coming-of-age rites of passage: these rites are just the start of the journey towards full adulthood; I am certainly not suggesting we can get to full adulthood that fast! As we age, one will have more opportunities to be initiated along the path towards full adulthood, whether facilitated by ourselves, community or life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;However, the coming-of-age rites are worth emphasizing.&lt;/strong&gt; As a society, we are placing ourselves in a developmental weak spot. This weakness comes from the mainstream obsession with the nuclear family as the best setting to raise children, resulting in an over-emphasis on parents during a time when the ‘allergic’ reaction of youth in their individuation process means parents are arguably at their lowest ability to directly mentor and guide their youth. We need a ‘village’ to rise us, a wider communal effort, one that can be a stronger container for all sorts of parenting arrangements and child-raising circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Structured, communal and intentional&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I come to the end of this piece, my thoughts turn to related questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how we are creating and holding the other rites of passage in our lives?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the shadow side of mentorship? How can the need to individuate or be initiated be exploited in ways that truly do not answer the question “What Serves?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For us ‘uninitiated’, how can we reposition ourselves along the path to full adulthood?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of things bubble up in response to those. What comes up for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steppingstonesproject.org/donate.html&quot;&gt;Stepping Stones Project&lt;/a&gt; if you can; The organization relies partially on donations, to increase the number of groups it can manage, and to cover scholarships for families that don’t have the financial means to afford the program. I donate my time, roughly 150 hours a year, to the cause but many of my co-leaders do not have the luxury of that and they need to be paid. Please, if you can, donate or contribute.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marking Ceremony]]></title><description><![CDATA[This past Sunday, my first rites of passage youth group “marked”.

The marking ceremony is the culmination of our three year program. It is an opportunity to bear witness to the transformations that each of the boys are experiencing in this period in their lives. The ceremony itself is just one facet of the entire rite of passage; our group time has been spent deep in the work of understanding this moment in their lives. We’ve spent time deep in nature, on adventures together and pushed ourselves with our fire vigil, dusk-till-dawn hike and solo nature sits. The boys have, at different times, exceeded our expectations and failed them. Courage, openness and depth have all been demonstrated deeply; but not in every instance. The boys are still trying on the responsibilities and possibilities of adulthood. And I am very much looking forward to continue to see this evolution as the group shifts into a new way of being over the coming months.

&lt;p&gt;This was the first substantial rites of passage ceremony I have facilitated to date. While I felt supported in many ways in my teenage years, I did not participate in any structured mentoring outside of the family or rites of passage initiation as a teenager. Only by listening to my peer leaders and the wider community of prior group leaders in the Stepping Stones Community, did the first possibilities of what our marking ceremony could be rise in my head. Every year we would hear accounts of marking ceremonies, and sit in councils where leaders consulted with the wider community about the plans and possibilities they held for their marking ceremonies. I am deeply in debt to the wisdom shared in all these meetings, written accounts and conversations over these years.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaise, my co-leader, and I started mentioning the ceremony and building it up with the boys and the parents many months ago. Just starting with occasional mentions of the “marking ceremony”, building up to connecting the relevance of what we were doing that day to the marking ceremony, months in the future. This last month, with our last summer trip, several group meetings and a parents meeting, we were deep in the co-creation of it with the boys, parents, Pat (our elder) and each other, as co-leads. I really enjoyed the rather organic process of how it all came together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parts of my initial vision involved being able to stand on a hill and look out over the bay, and using an invocation used by an Adelaide school for their rites of passage ceremony (one I had found in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/ritesofpassage/manhood/&quot;&gt;The New Manhood&lt;/a&gt;). At first, I was drawn to the hills overlooking the bay near Mt Tam, near where we had done our dusk-to-dawn hike. It was a real haul to get out there, a big consideration when we were planning for all the families to get out there as well. This became even more of a pressing issue when one of the mothers in the group fell from a horse a few weeks prior to the ceremony! In the end, one of the other mothers suggested the perfect spot, John Hinkel Park, a quiet North Berkeley park, with a stone amphitheater for the ceremonial space and a view of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge.

&lt;p&gt;For months and months, Chaise and I had been stopping in stores and shops on our travels through our daily lives and adventures, looking for worthwhile gifts for each of the boys. Nothing really felt right. Chaise had also considered making buckskin leather pouches for each of the boys but decided that that would be beyond his resources in the lead up to the ceremony. If we couldn’t get the right gifts, we resigned to skipping them as part of the ceremony altogether. Here, again, we were saved by the parents. One of the parents runs a business that provides little yoga gift boxes; she had an incredible stash of gems, stones and rocks (amongst other things), that she offered to us to pick over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaise and I spent a lovely afternoon sitting with the array of minerals and just letting our impulses and our thoughts of the lads guide us in picking out what was right. Without much effort, we arrived at our gifts. Each youth would get two group stones, that everyone in the group got. And one stone that was unique to them. We were drawn to some cool magnetic polished stones, seeing them stick together. Just like our group; we stick together. That was the first group stone. We were also drawn to the deep rippled greens of some malachite. When Chaise pulled up an internet search on the mineral and it said that it was symbolically linked to great change or transformation… perfect for our rite of passage moment, we selected that as our second group stone. The process of picking out unique stones for each of the boys was the most fun. One of us would pick up a stone and wait for the others assessment. “Ahh yes, you picked that one up for Douglas*“. Being so aligned on how we saw these stones and our boys was such a natural delight. We had our gifts, and a perfect integration into the ceremony; we would use each unique stone as the first prompt for our co-leader reflections and witness statement for each of the boys.

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these aspects in place, Chaise and I measured and paced out the ceremony in our heads, sharing the different steps and requirements with the parents, youth and Pat, our elder. I’ll pivot now to walking the reader through the ceremony as it unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started in the morning, with just the boys, at the Heart House. Over two years ago, when Chaise first joined the group, the boys had collected a huge pile of acorns, and Chaise had suggested that we could leech the tannins out of the acorns, mill them for flour and then bake something with them. Well, now was the time to fulfil that promise. We ended up baking muffins for the families, with a recipe provided by one of the lads. During this time, the lads wrote in the group journal, on the prompt “Saying goodbye to boyhood” and wrote out their threshold statements on manhood, in preparation of the ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we headed over to the park, and prepared the ceremonial space. A brazier for the fire, the altar space and connecting them, the threshold, representing the boundary between childhood and adulthood. After the fire got going, Chaise pulled out a bag of charcoal, collected from our prior fire-place councils. We had shared many deep moments around the fire place; it was an important motif of our time together. We had worked with fire-making many times and often asked the question, “what inner fire are we tending to?” when reflecting on the people that we were trying to become. The bag of charcoal contained a physical connection to those fires and those times of questioning. We explained to the lads, that by ourselves, as just the group, we would have our own special part of the ceremony before the families came.

&lt;p&gt;We would mark them with fire, using the charcoal, as a physical representation of the process they were undergoing and the ceremony we were just about to start. One by one, each of them came up for Chase, Pat and I, and we leaders and elder marked each of them with the charcoal. As I recall that moment, I pinch the charcoal between my thumb and index finger, crumbling it to draw long dark lines across the face of each strange creature that eagerly stood in front of me, initially starting with a few fresh canvases, and then adding to the marks already there from the other generations of mentors holding these boys close. As we marked the lads, we to, were marked by the moment as mentors.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moments later, the families began gathering off to the side. The boys, marked as they now were, sat together of their own volition; holding their separateness from the families. The group had such a strong identity separate from their family identities. As leaders and elder, we had seen the secret lives of the group of youth and the group of parents, and this was the first time when all three elements were arriving to share a little of our collective secret lives. The boys were calm and reserved, already feeling into their reluctance to share about their secret lives with the parents. However, their excitement broke through when they spotted an unexpected guest; Jeff, who co-led the group with me when we first began. You could see the urge to break ranks, rush up to him and see him up close ripple through the boys but they held their formation. Chaise dashed off for a moment to ready himself and I confirmed that everyone had arrived. The air was full of anticipation. Chaise returned, we embraced, and I rang the bell to break that anticipation, inviting us into ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ascended the stairs of the amphitheater, where at the top we could catch views of the bay and the bridge. I began with this the first part of the invocation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look below at this beautiful place, and this beautiful bay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Down there&lt;/strong&gt; in this city, across this bay, you have spent your boyhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen or fifteen years ago, you were born, your parents excited and amazed, doctors and nurses helping you make a start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Down there&lt;/strong&gt; you were a baby, a little toddler, loved and cared for, going to the park, the forest and the ocean. You played with friends, perhaps have brothers and sisters who were your companions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You got older, went to kindergarten and school. You had relatives and family, friends, mates you played with. What you needed was provided. You had a place to live, clothes, and a bed. You were taken care of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Down there&lt;/strong&gt; you played games, had holidays, perhaps travelled to other places and returned. You played and learnt, laughed and cried, you grew up, grew stronger and smarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You lived your boyhood. Down there, out there, is your boyhood.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think now, of all the people who helped you. Who fed you and healed you and taught you and cared for you. The homes that sheltered you, the family that loved you. The enemies and the friends you made. The sun that warmed you, the cold that you shivered in, the rain that came down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of your boyhood, and all that went into it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of your parents, who may be here right now, or where-ever they might be, and all their dreams and hopes for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Chaise, positioned behind the boys, begun from another direction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your boyhood is now ending.&lt;/strong&gt; Soon you will start to become a man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey to manhood is more than just the time we have spent together. It is a long road but you will begin that road today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, you begin turning from boyhood to manhood. But first, this is a chance to say goodbye. Goodbye to being a boy. And goodbye begins with saying thank you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just in your mind, send a thank-you for the people down there in that city, or far away across the earth, wherever you have lived and grown, who loved you, and cared for you, in small ways and large, the places, the experiences, the films, books, music, all that human tradition gave you, that made your boyhood rich and good. Even the painful times - the hurts, the betrayals, the disappointments that made you who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Begin to say goodbye to boyhood. Say thank you for your boyhood. Breathe deeply, and carry with you all these gifts into the next, new stage of life, a man’s life. &lt;strong&gt;Welcome to the journey of becoming a man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bell rung out once more, the tone carrying in the wind, and we invited the families to form two lines for a processional guard, through which the group would walk back down into the amphitheater. The youth, group members and their younger siblings, sat on the right side of the amphitheater. The adults sat on the left side, with the boundary between the two demarked by the threshold we had earlier built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pat, our elder, opened this part of the ceremony, with his story of the journey of the group. He spoke to the wildness of the group, its early difficult days, and his early doubts as to whether the group would ever drop into a space of openness and realness with one another. And, then reflecting on the sharp contrast to his experiences with the group in the last few months; the depth of sharing in council, the ability to hold both wild adventure and a deeper space of reflection. His spoke to his awe and admiration of witnessing the self-work that the boys had been engaging with over these years. Pat, as a Zen Buddhist, shared that the way in his Buddhist tradition of showing the deepest respect for someone’s process was to grace them with three full bows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To watch Pat, with 73 years on him, prostrate himself three full times in front of the boys… Pat has shared with us several times about his reckoning with growing old and the lost of his energy and agility. There was something unspeakably profound to me to see him do this. The certain but strained movements, so well practiced but clearly impacted by the tolls of time. The peace of the moment, with only the lightest scraping of Pat’s shoes on the asphalt surface and the gentle rustling of leaves on the breeze. I feel a joyful and reverential grief welling in my chest as I think about it. Once more, the bell rang out across the amphitheater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaise and I then spoke. To recognising the traditional peoples of the land, the Chochenyo Ohlone, who had no doubt practiced vital forms of initiation and rites of passage on these lands. To the place of this marking ceremony in the overall rite of passage we were participating in, as a important time to witness and note the transition and passage that has been the work of the group over these years. And we spoke to the gifts and what the group stones both represented.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then began the meat of the ceremony. Seven times, we would pick a random bag from the bags of gifts (stuck conveniently together by the magnetic group stones). Each time it would start the same sequence:
The youth would be called forward, presented in this way, to the ‘whole village’. The leaders would offer the gift, and share their reflections and witness statements. The group would be invited to share their reflections of the presented youth. Then the presented youth would be called to approach the threshold, and from the other side, his family would be invited to do the same. His family would then share their reflections and words, voiced across the threshold. The family would then take up the bowl of water and mirror, holding those up for the youth, supporting the youth as them ‘did the work’ to cleanse away the markings they had received. Finally, the youth was invited to drop the piece of paper with their first statement of manhood into the brazier, pause on the threshold as the bell rang out, and, once the tone of the bell had sounded out, cross over to the adult side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time round was such a sweet treat. We would open the bag, pulling from it that youth’s special stone. We shared about why the stone evoked that boy to us. Its texture, the variation or pattern of its coloring, its ‘feel’, the feelings or thoughts it brought to us. And then Chaise and I would share our reflections. The openness to bettering oneself that we had seen in one youth. The cool composure of another youth. The leadership shown and demonstrated. The wildness and hilarious reality of another.

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, initially begrudgingly, shared recollections of moments they had shared with the presented youth. As the ceremony progressed, one of the youth had clearly taken it upon himself to share about each and every one of the other boys, even standing to share before the group had been called upon to do so! Two or three members of the group would speak up, with some comic and loving moments, for each of the presented youth, before the bell would sound again and we would invite the parents and presented youth to the threshold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then so many endearing moments of parents sharing, with deep emotion and love. It is beautiful to just be able to sit back to witness such intimate love and gratitude shared within families. And to watch each of the lads, in their own ways, cross the threshold. Noticing how they held themselves. How they paused on the threshold, and where they looked, some looking forward to where they would be stepping into the adult world; some watching me with the bell, silently asking if it was time to cross and silently waiting for the bearest of nods or blink of my eyes. Seeing them step over the threshold, and walk away, each time with applause ringing across the amphitheater. Indelible moments in my memory. Seven times they were called forward, and seven times the bell rung as they crossed the threshold.

&lt;p&gt;It was done. Chaise spoke, to note the difference in where folks were sitting at the start of the ceremony to where they were sitting now. Pat closed the ceremony, sharing the Poem “Rites of Passage” by Thom Gunn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Something is taking place.
Horns bud bright in my hair.
My feet are turning hoof.
And Father, see my face
–Skin that was damp and far
Is barklike and, feel, rough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; See Greytop how I shine.
I rear, break loose, I neigh
Snuffing the air, and harden
Toward a completion, mine.
And next I make my way
Adventuring through your garden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; My play is earnest now.
I canter to and fro.
My blood, it is like light.
Behind an almond bough,
Horns gaudy with its snow,
I wait live, out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; All planned before my birth
For you, Old Man, no other,
Whom your groin’s trembling warns.
I stamp upon the earth
A message to my mother.
And then I lower my horns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, we broke bread, and feasted as one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years. The easiest recalled words from our Stepping Stones training, “Every group follows its own path”. The wild energy. Losing boys early on. Losing Jeff, my first co-lead, and gaining Chaise, the savior of the group. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/ritesofpassage/losing-gerald/&quot;&gt;Losing Gerald&lt;/a&gt;. Learning about fire, getting lost, jumping off rocky cliffs into the wild river below, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/ritesofpassage/overnightmttam/&quot;&gt;watching the fog consume the whole bay, nay, the whole world, at 1am on the top of Mt Tam&lt;/a&gt;, nights out in tents, under the stars. And my own initiation. An initiation into mentorship, responsibility and leadership. Of guiding youth, of facilitating council, of spanning the distance between the sacred and the profane. At times, dragging the group into happening by sheer force of will, against everything else pulling it apart. Feeling into the support of the community, of Pat, of my co-leads, my Cali-family and Chels when I felt spent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels whole, to be marked by this process, a depth of contentment. I feel the tendrils of my future-thinking-mind, pulling me towards thoughts of what-needs-to-be-done-next and how-can-we-scale-this-for-others-to-benefit. But I like this place, this moment of contentment, so I think I will stay here for just a moment longer…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We set out on our long road trip after loading up the truck, stopping at In-And-Out
and then continuing on to the cabin. The boys were split, three and three, in each
of the vehicles. Both cars steamed along with great conversation heading up,
including little games like ‘Never Have I Ever”. The theme of sex happened to
come up a lot in both vehicles, largely in the ‘oooo gross’ sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the weekend progressed, this theme kept coming up amongst the boys. We did
remark that despite the ‘yuck, gross’ sentiments shared, by bringing it up
constantly, it was clear that the lads were curious about the topic! One of the boys
mentioned that it felt weird to talk to their parents around the subject, and that it
was nice to have a space to share about it. Another huge theme was that of
confidentiality, which we discussed a length with the lads. We again reiterated how
we would share themes and activities from the weekend, without naming names or
identifying who said what. The boys ought to be able to read this summary and not
feel outed for anything said, so hopefully we are walking the line on this topic!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jumping back to our narrative timeline: we arrived at the cabin and settled in for
the night. Getting the lads to sleep was a challenge, as anticipated. Four hours in a
car, in a nervous/exciting new situation with a group, and being early teenagers…
It isn’t hard to imagine. Eventually we had to sit in the landing between the two
rooms and declare that we weren’t moving until the lads were asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we set out on a short hike in the Sugar Pine State Park
surrounding the area Bob’s cabin is in. We got to smell the awesome butterscotch
delight of the Jeffrey Pine, as we hiked into the park. While only a three mile hike the boys were very clear in their displeasure of having to trundle even that far!
Across the group, that seems like a mix of boredom and then just aversion to
having to walk so much. Well, I hope our relationship to hiking and being in
nature will evolve a little in the coming years! We played lots of eagle eye on the
hike, a form of hide and seek and one of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; favorite parts of the weekend was
facilitating the sound stalk with Dan; blindfolding the lads out in a field and having
them try to silently find their way to Dan, who would periodically ring a large bell
we brought along for the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the hike, we sat briefly for a short ‘swear-word/curse-word’
council. This was prompted by one of the boys expressing a difficult with the use of curse words by other boys in the group. We wanted the group to share what their experience (and their parent’s
perspectives) on curse-words, so that we all knew where we stood and that it made
some of the group uncomfortable. We agreed to strive to avoid making folks in the
group uncomfortable. This was both an excellent chance for the group to share
about how their actions impacted each other but also to continue to learn more
about the structure and place of council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the hike, we headed to the lake for a very refreshing cool dip. Everyone got
into the water! There were certainly some fears and anxieties expressed before we
arrived to the lake: did everyone have to get in? Will it be too cold? I don’t want to
get wet.. Etc. But everyone joined in, without the prior reluctance. After the lake,
we returned to the cabin, for a little more nature time, then dinner and finally a
camp-fire out behind the cabin.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The camp-fire started with smores, of course. As the fire burned, the banter and
silliness gave way to a deeper space. We did eventually fall into a council of sorts,
using one of the marshmallow prongs as a talking piece. The boys got to answer a
prompt about one thing their parents didn’t know about them, or one thing they
hadn’t told the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the girls groups in stepping stones integrate themes
around the moon and menstrual cycle into their rite of passage work, as a potent
and tangible facet of their lives at this time. For boys groups, fire can be a great
similar metaphor or theme for youth. We introduced this idea to the boys; that
learning about fire and tending to fire will be a theme of our time together. Over
the course of the coming years, we want the group to keep coming back to the
question: “What fire are we tending to?”, to help them reflect on what sort of
person and inner-flame they are creating in themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After another rambunctious start to bed-time, we slept, woke up early, ate, cleaned
up the cabin and made our way home. Over the weekend, we saw a lot of bonding,
and also had spent enough time together to see some of the edges of our
personalities bump into each other. Overall the group feels pretty good, coming
together nicely, with a few dynamics for Bob, Dan and I to keep an eye on. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the dust settled, we heard back from one of the families. The lad who had had difficulty with the swearing in the group was, in reflection, quite dejected about the whole weekend. They had also struggled with the noise and boisterous nature of the other boys in the group, during the trip. Their parents relayed, very neutrally, how this lad had felt singled out in the council process; since he was the one most impacted by the swearing. And that the boys were willfully swearing near him and then sarcastically hugging him sorry as a consequence, perhaps in following the letter but not the spirit of the agreement to not swear near this boy. During our informal council at the campfire, he had wanted to share this feedback with the group but had held himself back. It seemed from the parent’s retelling that the lad had some resentment that we had not come out and declared swearing wrong and off limits. His folks don’t quite know where his disdain for curse-words stems from, being they are not anti-curse word themselves, nor religious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our experience of this lad has been that he finds the company of his age-peers difficult. He has to be talked through strong emotional reactions to the idea of hanging out with age-peers, and orients towards the adults of the group. He has had several good day-longs with the group, however his experience of the weekend trip, with some highs and certainly some lows for him, is dominated by his low experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be meeting with him in the coming weeks, to try and hear his story directly and give him some reflections on his choice to either stay or leave the group. In my mind, it is a challenging choice because he can either speak his truth to a smaller group of his peers, with the leaders support, and we can collectively find a way to be together in greater harmony and respect. Or, he can opt out, leave and then try to figure out how to relate to his peers, effectively on his own. He won’t get this sort of support in his school and I don’t believe he is getting professional help from a counselor or therapist. I don’t envy his choice or consider it an easy one; imagine feeling completely alienated by boys and girls around your age, finding interacting with them stressful and having only one main strategy, avoidance, to navigate group situations. Some times we do need to run-away, and recoup or find a situation that is better for us. But if we are always running away, where do we end up? I hope this lad can find his peace, in the group or out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

This watch list is my attempt at that longer view. The watch list’s goal is to be a list of big-impact interventions and signals pertaining to the climate challenge, ideally with indicators for their state and a link to someone/something that is tracking that state at consistent intervals. It should be something I can come back to periodically to get a recap of the biggest trackable climate chaos factors, with some consistency of comparison from year to year. Without a watch list, it will be too easy for me (or anyone for that matter) to get lost in the weeds and tumble of ad-hoc climate reporting, and my daily life &amp;#x26; responsibilities. Why do folks get lost and struggle to direct their actions and thinking about climate matters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/bg2-98cc8c6ef3c38275846f2521e6f518ef.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;break&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without too much effort, one can find a lot of news updates or commentaries on climate related matters, even if the ‘main-stream media’ is still somewhat inept at covering climate issues. There is, however, several challenges to getting to a place of insight around the climate challenge. To start, climate science commentary/news media is a heavily contested or adversarial information environment. There has been a significant amount of money, and then political influence poured into sowing fear, uncertainty and doubt about science pertaining to climate matters, mainly on the denialist side. Even within those that recognise human-caused climate change, there are clashing narratives on how it is currently and will in the future play out. Part of those narratives includes certain types of environment aesthetic that can get in the way of insight: when climate actions or lifestyles have to look a certain way to be environmentally sound/regenerative/sustainable, we can lose effective interventions or measures to get us closer to climate stability. The other great ‘noise’ in all the climate ‘signal’ are climate/weather/natural disasters and problems, presented without reliable baselines of activity. If a terrible storm system hits a coastal town, is it or isn’t it related to climate chaos? Without a contextual depth to the reporting, about storm frequencies and distributions, we are left in uneasy uncertainly about whether a ‘news’ event should update our understanding of the state of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This general state of confusion, uncertainly and the difficult narratives that surround the climate challenge makes effective and coordinated action difficult. This watch list is my own attempt to overcome that for my decision making; Perhaps it will be useful for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is not in any order, and will be my running best estimate for the top factors we ought to be tracking to have a strategic view of the climate challenge. No single individual or organization should pretend or attempt to work on all of these areas. The challenge space is so large and varied however, that we should actively support a range of interventions and efforts to address the climate challenge. While individuals and organizations should probably focus on solving one or few parts of the challenge, claims that there is a silver bullet solution or one intervention that everyone needs to do are naive; considering the situation we have put ourselves in, we are going to need a lot of changes in how we steward the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to read the watch-list&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulk of the list focuses on interventions. These are actions and efforts that we can take to address the climate challenge. We probably need a strong mix of many of these interventions to be implemented to truly address the climate challenge but it is wise not to get too focused on any particular intervention; we might roll it out and find it does not produce the results we desire. As it currently stands, even if we hugely rolled out these intervention in the coming decade, we still face the risk that some climate related impacts will get worse before they get better. We are already seeing serious ecological degradation and flow on strain on human systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottom part of the list are signals we should be paying attention to, in order to track the overall health of earth, from an ecological perspective. They provide gross (overall) feedback on planetary wide factors; we should still be very interested in impacts at more localized levels, particularly when evaluating and understanding interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intention for the watch-list will be to continue to find good quality intervention/signal sources and continue periodically review progress (or otherwise) in the coming years. And to ultimately have that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/littleciv/littleciv/&quot;&gt;inform forecast updates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Built-environment &lt;a name=&quot;built&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The built environment refers to the structures we live and work in. Globally, most of those structures are in cities; since 2007 the majority of humanity resides in cities, with that percentage continuing to increase. Emissions occur both in the construction of these buildings and then over their lifetime, primarily from heating/cooling and ventilation. Globally, most building in the next decade will occur in China, with India and Africa being the projected major building sites of the following two decades&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Zero Code is a emissions neutral building code being advocated by Architecture 2030, to shift building materials/techniques and change building designs to effectively eliminate emissions from our built-environment. Architecture 2030 are gathering over 60 of the top multi-national architectural firms in September 2019, to get them to sign on to Zero Code. These firms constitute much of the leading edge of building design work being done in places like China, and are well positioned to influence the projected African and Indian building booms in the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Societal Cost of Emissions &lt;a name=&quot;carbonprice&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollution, green house gases emissions and ecological degradation are negative externalities of much our current patterns of production and consumption. Externalities are costs suffered by third parties as a result of economic activity. If we fail to price and account for emissions as negative externalities, we will continue to promote economic activity that makes a profit for those directly involved, at the cost of the greater good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many promising ecological restoration interventions and emission control technologies will have their implementation and development hampered unless we can price or tax ecological negative externalities and then redirect that money to regenerative technology R &amp;#x26; D and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Land-use &lt;a name=&quot;land&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human activity &lt;em&gt;prior&lt;/em&gt; to industrialization was a sufficient boost in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels (from 240 to 280 ppm) to effectively avoid the start of the next glaciation period, and subsequently, in several thousand years, the next ice age. This change mainly stemmed from our land-use, through deforestation, urbanization, agriculture and grassland degradation. While the use of fossil fuels does dominate our imagery around the climate challenge, this impact from our relationship to the land (and ocean) is still very much with us. Restoration and changes in land-use do not mean removing human activity from ecological systems. There are many ways we can actively participate as stewards of ecological systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicators: I don’t think there are globally recognised ways of comparing the level of regenerative land-use, especially between different types of ecologies. Even REDD+ has been critiqued and subsequently improved for there being a disconnect between metrics and impacts on the land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Global Signals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global signals are more about keeping track of the impacts of climate change. These should help us get a general sense of whether things are getting better or worse with how we are facing up to the climate challenge. These include global average metrics for things like CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or temperature and ecological systems that have an out-sized impact on global ecological health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Global metrics &lt;a name=&quot;metrics&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/&quot;&gt;Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Global agricultural yields (USDA has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/world-agricultural-production&quot;&gt;reporting on global yields&lt;/a&gt;, however I am concerned that its forced move to Kansas and the general dismantling of the Federal Government may impact the accuracy of its reporting over time)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Amazon &lt;a name=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Amazon’s scale and impact is such that its health is something of a global symbol of how our relationship to nature is going, and thus it makes it on to my list of top indicators. Unfortunately, as I type this, media reports of expansive fires and further attacks on communities indigenous to the Amazon are trickling out of Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to watch in this domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deforestation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecological collapse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ice &lt;a name=&quot;ice&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surface ice, frozen water locked into glaciers, ice shelves and the like, represent a vast stock of potential sea-level rise if melted. Sea-ice and surface ice both contribute to high albedo earth surfaces, better at reflecting the radiative energy of the sun (consequently, the more of it we lose, the faster the earth will heat up). Finally, accelerated glacier melt risks flash-flooding and the loss of fresh water from certain ecologies and human settlements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Ocean health &lt;a name=&quot;oceanhealth&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oceans represent a huge part of earth’s ecology that we tend to literally just skim over the surface of. It is a huge thermal and chemical buffer in the global ecology; it has absorbed a lot of energy and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over the centuries since industrialization. We do risk that it will become less capable of acting as this buffer, and that significant system wide chaos and change will stem from changes to the oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What to watch in this domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ocean Acidification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ocean Oxygen Depletion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over-fishing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Levels of Plastic and Other Waste&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coral reef health as signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indicators: Ocean health metrics including change in oxygen content, agricultural nutrient run-off, fish stocks, whale populations, pH level of ocean areas and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it for now! Donate to effective climate causes (I donate about 5% of my income), support organizations that seek a regenerative relationship to the land, ocean and nature. PUSH politicians and government services at ALL levels to organize coherent climate policies. Don’t let the wish-wash of random happening get you down; focus on the long-term picture (even though it is tough!) and keep pushing to find ways to create the opportunity for a better relationship to our global ecology!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Run and done: My wrap up for the GSSS 2019]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is the second post in a short series of reflections about my time at the Santa Fe Institute’s Global Sustainability Summer School.

&lt;p&gt;My time at SFI is done! Woah, what an experience! Every day learning so much from the lecturers and everyone in the cohort. Multiple times different folks remarked that it felt like an intellectual holiday; having a lot of fun, meeting new people, stepping outside your usual routine and getting drenched in new ideas, conversation and concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of my overall outlook on sustainability, these two weeks covered a range of challenges I was already aware of but also uncovered some remediations I was not. So, my baseline outlook for climate action did go up as a result of the course. Unfortunately in the last few weeks we have also seen studies published on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/2019GL082187&quot;&gt;accelerated melting of arctic permafrosts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6451/369&quot;&gt;accelerated melting of glaciers that terminate in warming seas&lt;/a&gt;, beyond what has previously been modelled. Perhaps it is a wash then… I will have to have a deeper reflection on how to update my forecasts at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;SFI, the faculty and the cohort&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actual campus itself is wonderful. A fairly small facility, sharing the gorgeous New Mexican Adobe aesthetic, situated up the hill to the north-west of the Santa Fe downtown area. It felt inviting, and curious; what or who was around the next door or corner, what curious work were they embroiled in? The course faculty was drawn from in-residence scholars and other visiting academics, entrepreneurs and public officials; all of whom were very approachable, humble and insightful. The choice of lecturers was a function of Luis Bettencourt’s judgement and network, to which we are all indebted. And my dear cohort mates!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So often with these group learning experiences, it is the people that come, and the extent that they share of themselves that determines the richness of the experience. I certainly felt that deep richness, and was able to share and listen to so many stories and perspectives over the last two weeks. Adding to that, the adventures we managed to fit into such little time; Wednesday night karaoke, a 16 mile Saturday hike to Baldy Peak and Lake Katherine, high above Santa Fe; and our block-buster Sunday of Meow Wolf, Kakawa drinking chocolate and Ten Thousand Waves Onsen. I really want the cohort to keep actively communicating and being in touch, to see how we each take our SFI time forward into our lives and careers. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Making the GSSS better&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could we have gotten even more out of the experience? Any group delving into intellectual matters ought to spend a time aligning its knowledge management practices. We had a group email, wiki and a slack channel and initially relied on group emails and word of mouth to clarify their use. We got great use out of those communication tools and knowledge bases but after a few days I realized we still had a bunch of folks that were unfamiliar or unaware of the tools we were using and how to use them. Even a 30 minute segment at the start of the course would have helped the whole cohort sync up on how we were managing our collective knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is next?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several folks asked me that question over the last few weeks, really appreciate the prompt to reflect. The things that are coming directly out of my time at SFI are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Los Angeles City “green-waste + gasification = biochar” effort&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating my climate ‘watch list’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bringing Sustainable Cities to HERE&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Gasification + biochar&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Petersen, who was a key driver in the first pLAn for a sustainable Los Angeles, presented during the course. He described waste management as one of the biggest pain points for LA City’s achievement of its sustainability planning. I briefly checked in with him then about whether the city had considered using gasification plants to turn their green-waste into biochar (a topic I had learnt about a week prior, via the Farm to Taber podcast). He did not know if it had been considered. Fast forward to now, after a bunch of research and my end of cohort presentation, and I am now in the process of trying to get in touch with the relevant LA City officials to provide them with a policy brief on the possibility of gasification technology and biochar. Will Matt put me in touch with a collection of LA City peeps and will those peeps hear me out? Who knows! Stay tuned to find out! My goal is to trigger a policy discussion and enumeration of whether gasification tech could help LA City.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Updating the “watch list”&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To update my &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/littleciv/littleciv/&quot;&gt;forecasts&lt;/a&gt;, I need to have a comprehensive but non-overwhelming list of the biggest factors/indicators for the progress (or otherwise) of climate chaos. The course certainly added some indicators to the list but I am yet to sit down and really compile this list. Hoping I can get to that by mid September by the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Getting HERE more involved in Sustainable Cities&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My company, HERE Technology, already has vast troves of geospatial data that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be handy for cities that are trying to become more sustainable. We already do some ‘Smart cities’ and urban mobility work, providing services and data to optimize that. But there are a range of other ideas I have brewing that could help HERE be more useful to cities or urbanities from a sustainability perspective. The challenge is: I can see a range of ways we could be useful for cities but few have clear avenues for making a profit, from the company’s perspective. Again, I will have to see how this evolves in time. For now, I am reaching out to the folk in the company that are looking at urban mobility and smart cities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What next for the planet and for the cohort?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it is apparent that humanity has a lot of work ahead of it to deal with the climate challenge. One should avoid any yearning to reduce the problems or solutions down to one or even a few factors. This is a huge multi-faceted challenge, and we will need to bring a host of solutions and efforts to bear, if we are to have any hope of maintaining our ecosystem without significant collapse or loss of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course focus on the city level has been very helpful though, in filling out a broader picture of what is going on in the vast field of climate effort. Since nation-states are currently struggling to make good progress on climate issues, many provincial, state and city-level governments are stepping up to the challenge; some are even being given recognition and a voice at the supra-national level, via the UN, World Bank, or international city-lead initiatives such as the C40 effort. Considering that cities contain the bulk of humanity, and will increasingly do so, this effort is both heartening and increasingly necessary. There is a lot of good work that can be done, at the city and state level, to make progress on the climate challenge. I really hope to hear all about the different ways our cohort get involved in these efforts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are still a bunch of big questions about urbanization, humanity and ecology coming to me after the course; what is a sustainable form of urban density? Is there a specific human-scale to that density that we should be aiming for? Can we even hope to achieve that in the complexity of urban spaces? Is it possible to maintain some of the innovative and creative benefits of city life, but at a reduced density? I want to find some time to even pose these questions and reflect on whether we could even ever answer them without some grand experiments. &lt;/p&gt;

I have shared the post with a range of groups, hoping to get a solid range of critiques and feedback on my writing, my first pass of forecasts and the Little Civilization mental model. I really appreciate the time all of these folks took to read my post, especially if they felt called to share their reactions to it. There are about five distinct segments of readers that I will address one by one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Slate Star Codex&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open discussion threads of &lt;a href=&quot;https://slatestarcodex.com/&quot;&gt;Slate Star Codex&lt;/a&gt; are a critique heavy space for wading into almost any hot or intellectual topic of the day. A decent discussion kicked off when I posted in the correct discussion thread, dying off when I could not reply during a lovely seven day spell in different wilderness areas (photos of which I use as visual breaks in my posts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got some direct feedback about the gaps in explanation around the Little Civ mental model; some good directions for deeper dives in the future. The biggest push back I got was on the forecasts, and the concern that they were based on faulty climate modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Climate modelling&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a general concern with climate modelling that it is error prone. It is trying to model a wide array of known and unknown variables/dynamics over a huge area and long time spans. The modelling that is done is quite comprehensive and is including more research and computation power every year, as I describe in the original post. However, critique of the models is important, in order to push them towards a better forecasting fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we do not need precise to-the-year accuracy in our predictions to have a strong sense of where the climate is going, and to act accordingly. Beyond those that reject climate science and modelling altogether, there are folk that argue that, yes, climate change is happening but that the models overstate it and that warming is happening much slower than predicted. There were several commentators in the SSC open thread that took this position. In essence, they argue that climate change is happening slower than the IPCC is predicting and that we actually have centuries to adapt and adjust. And consequently, everyone can calm down, there is no need for sudden changes. Humanity’s generalized rate of cultural and technological change ought to be sufficient to accommodate this level of slow warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether even larger (than current) climate impacts are likely to occur in the next few years, next decade, in 50 years time or in 200 years time really changes what sorts of measures we should be taking to deal with the climate challenge. Climate change would be VASTLY easier for us to deal with if its worse effects were not going to show up for 200+ years. And essentially it would ‘let us off the hook’ (us being the bulk of the population) about our voting, advocacy and lifestyle choices around consumption, growth and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/agateSouth-fb485a2357254749f317c9d29c9092bb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;break&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what were their reference points for arguing that change was happening slower than the IPCC was forecasting? They linked to a mix of sources, including CATO, personal blog posts and Judith Curry’s well known climate science critique blog. The arguments were from &lt;a href=&quot;https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/regulation/2013/9/regv36n3-6n.pdf&quot;&gt;2013&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://daviddfriedman.blogspot.com/2014/03/have-past-ipcc-temperature.html&quot;&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;. The CATO report mainly critiques several US Global Change Research Program
reports but includes some references to the IPCC reporting, which is an important basis for my forecasts. The key overlap in argument across those sources was that climate change was occurring slower than the IPCC models had been predicting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timings can be everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These analyses were conducted at the end of a 12-15 year ‘plateau’ in warming, often referred to by skeptics as a warming ‘pause’. It is easy to just look at this period of data, and come to a conclusion (warming is only happening at a very slow rate) that does not match the conclusion reached from the full data set. I asked the commentators whether they had updated or more recent sources that reached the same conclusions. Unfortunately they did not have any on hand (and I get that they would not necessarily want to spend their own time searching for extra sources). So what has happened since then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last five years there has been a considerable spike in global mean temperature, ~0.4C in a few years (2011-2016), and then another drop of ~0.15C (2016-2018), according to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/&quot;&gt;NASA data&lt;/a&gt;. This variability over short time periods (between 5 and 20 years) is only surprising if you have a very simple mental model of how the temperature increase is happening, or will be predicted to happen over time. Given the last five or so years of data, talk of the ‘pause’ has died down, even amongst climate science skeptics, &lt;a href=&quot;https://judithcurry.com/?s=pause&quot;&gt;for example, Judith Curry&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaf372&quot;&gt;Two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aaf342&quot;&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; published at the end of 2018 also comprehensively delved into the question of whether the measurements and the models diverge, and whether the ‘pause’ exists. They conclude no such ‘pause’ occurred, and that the models and temperature records do not significantly diverge over the long term. Hopefully when I post this back to the SSC open treads, I will be able to get a little more critique and feedback on these studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/agateNorthHigh-a231409ca396eebd123cec40e787644d.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;break&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Close circle friends&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shared the post and got early feedback by directly approaching a selection of folks close to me. Unsurprisingly, many I first shared it with I would consider folks that are sympathetic and open to the topics discussed in the post (although none are into forecasting per se), and generally have lots of overlap with me in terms of world outlook and interests. Of course, if folks already have a high degree of world-view overlap, they are often already primed to understand one another, compared to sharing information/thoughts between any given two people. So, to see if one’s writing and thoughts are clearer in a more general sense, one must share in wider circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Wider circle (via social media)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to prior posts of my dancing or rites-of-passage youth mentorship (both shorter and more ‘agreeable’ content), my Little Civ post got relatively little attention, reaction or click-through. A few of my more contrarian wider circle folk appreciated it, and shared but in general, it did not catch much attention. No feedback is difficult to parse. Was it too boring, too long, too unpalatable, too numeric, etc or a combination of all of the above? Has the Facebook algorithm figured out that all I am posting on their platform is links out of their domain, and thus encouraging folks to spend less time on their platform? Who knows! On to the next group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Deep Adaptation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get feedback from folks who are de facto forecasting Big Civilization collapse risks as coming much sooner than I am. The Deep Adaptation movement is such a group. Loosely defined, it is a broad group of folks that are concerned by or certain of civilizational collapse occurring as a result climate chaos, and trying to deeply adapt to that. It includes folks that believe in near-term-human-extinction (NTHE) on one extreme, to folks that see collapse as probable in the next 10-15 years, to folks like myself that are concerned about collapse risk in the coming decades/century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did this community have other data, other models, or other analyses as to why collapse will or might happen sooner than anticipated (&lt;a href=&quot;http://lifeworth.com/deepadaptation.pdf&quot;&gt;beyond the original paper, certainly worth a read&lt;/a&gt;)? While more of this community clicked-through to the post, there still was not much substantial feedback generated, aside from a few affirmations (again, that I do greatly appreciate).&lt;/p&gt;

More directed at those in the cohort!&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute&quot;&gt;Santa Fe Institute&lt;/a&gt; has a deep focus on complex adaptive systems, such as organisms, ecosystems, cities and similar. In the lead up to my time at SFI for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/summerschool/&quot;&gt;GSSS&lt;/a&gt;, I have been pondering what I want to get out of the experience and how best to achieve that. One frame falling out of that process is “If our GSSS cohort of faculty and students is itself a complex social system, what system characteristics and leverage points can we identify and experiment with?“. This post is mainly for the purpose of kicking off this question within the cohort.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Cohort characteristics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a short list of what characteristics I want the cohort to have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Belonging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Curiosity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intellectual rigor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trust and belonging are an important basis for any functioning social unit. Having a basic level of trust in a group allows us to start being open with our expressions and thoughts. Belonging drives a sense of connection with a group, increasing our own comfort, our emotional investment in the group and the overall group cohesion. Whatever ways we can collectively work to deepen trust and belonging within the cohort, the stronger anchoring we will have in our experience and work together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuity is an important element for me and I hope others in the cohort. I want to be able to continue to learn from and collaborate with folks from the cohort well after the GSSS finishes at the end of the month (acknowledging that we are all busy folk). Each of us will have a different analysis of the merits of continuing to engage with the rest of the cohort after we finish the GSSS; I certainly hope we can make continuing to collaborate and learn together a compelling prospect, post July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity and intellectual rigor are also important facets of this experience for me. We are delving into a deep intellectual topic and process; I would love to be explicit about what norms we can practice to encourage that. In part, the types of folks that are drawn to this endeavor will already be practicing many behaviors that will support this aspect of our time together. Social dynamics can sometimes get in the way of intellectual pursuits; conforming via group-think, loud voices (including myself!) risk drowning out the quieter voices, at times critiquing ideas can come off as critiquing individuals, and more. If one is not careful, we can end up with practices that degrade one of the above characteristics at the benefit of another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were going into a two week intensive study group, what characteristics would you want the group to hold?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Leverage points&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are framing the GSSS cohort as a complex social system, then what are the leverage points for us to shift this system? Often when we come together in these group situations, we already tend to use a range of practices to generate or reinforce norms in the group; I’m sure the faculty have various plans for this! In writing about this, I am hoping to create a little space for each of us in the cohort to reflect on both our own leverage points for creating the cohort experience that we want, and also to reflect on what practices we can instill as a group to get closer to our ideal cohort experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a personal perspective, do we need to strive to be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More willing to say “I’m not sure, let’s research it quickly”?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More open to questions that seem obvious to anyone in our field of specialization?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More ready to work through cross-cultural confusions and missteps?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More committed to speaking out and up in group settings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More willing to create space for others to share their perspective?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More introspective to identify what assumptions or cruxes are the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement&quot;&gt;source of a disagreement?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a short list of possible leverage points in our own behavior; the hope is that you get some time to ponder a few key ones for you to focus on, specific to your own context.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, and with much more coordination required, what are possible group practices that can be leverage points to shift the group?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Carla has emailed out the SFI’s ‘policy to prevent sexual harassment and misconduct’, which outlines the behavioral expectations and organizational mechanisms in place to avoid the negative social, individual and legal ramifications of sexual misconduct. This gives the cohort an important baseline of safety and trust (as long as it is adhered to). Beyond this policy (one mandated by law), we should also ask; Further than just avoiding negative dynamics in our social system, what can we do to create a positive and inclusive environment within the cohort? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I am sure some of these practices and norms are already planned for. Is there time, space and interest in adding more or modifying some practices?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some group leverage points we are using or might use, off the top of my head:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;async, persistent communications: slack, email list; to help with continuity of the cohort over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;communal dynamics; icebreakers, circling processes such as council, trust building exercises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dialogues about values; community agreements, community aspirations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feedback agreements such as CASK feedback (consensual, actionable, specific, kind feedback)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mention council, as in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://waysofcouncil.net/what-is-council/&quot;&gt;‘way of council’&lt;/a&gt;, as taught by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ojaifoundation.org/about/mission/&quot;&gt;Ojai Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, as a specific practice that is 1) unlikely to be one known to the cohort, 2) one I am familiar with and 3) have found rich in instilling trust and belonging in groups. It would certainly be a practice that attends to the emotional and social aspects of us coming together, stepping outside of lecture, group discussion and/or workshop mode of group being that we would usually anticipate in an institution setting like SFI. Our fears, hopes, desires and emotions can shape the sorts of intellectual questions &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; answers we are willing to consider, especially if left unconsidered. Exploring that would certainly be the direction I would want to take any cohort council in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to Monday!&lt;/p&gt;

This is a form of preparation for me, for my time at SFI. A time of deep enquiry into the state of the planet, and what my place in everything is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movement and dance is a part of that process for me. This is what fell out of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the winter break, my partner and I took the time to expansively map out the factors and possibilities of the coming century. This swept across the spectrum of developments in our own paths, our relationship, and the wider field of the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is exciting to deeply plan out things, with someone you love and so dearly care for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is an exploration into a mental model for how we orient to the world around us, from a civilizational perspective, and how our planning led to such a model.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I relished the chance to do some research and make forecasts about the various possibilities ahead. While the specific permutations of opportunities, happenstances and setbacks that will pop up in our daily lives are unknowable, there is still a yearning for and value in trying to forecast and navigate the currents of uncertainty in global trends. Some of the tools I lean on to consider this include: &lt;a href=&quot;https://fs.blog/2018/05/probabilistic-thinking/&quot;&gt;probabilistic thinking&lt;/a&gt;, tips from Philip Tetlock’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2LF2q8h&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Superforecasting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a grab-bag of techniques I picked up while working in the intelligence community. I am grateful for my time in the community instilling some important lessons in me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can only make decisions based on the information that we hold at the time a decision needs to be made. And while retrospectives are useful learning exercises, emotionally and spiritually we have to come to a place of peace with what decisions we have made in the past. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is information that we do not have, are there proxies we could use to get indirect understanding of a situation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Certainty makes our arguments more persuasive, however that does not make the outcomes or reality we predict any more certain. Being able to accurately convey uncertainty (vs doubt and apprehension) is a challenging but vital matter when sharing your forecasts and analyses with others. And as listeners, we should ask how someone is factoring in probability and uncertainty in their arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the big thing we came away with from our planning and forecasting? The excitement of mapping out our desired adventures and possibilities, and the harsh interjection of climate chaos into that. While I have been tracking climate developments in an ad hoc fashion for some time, this was the first time of really digging into different angles, aspects and models for what is happening with the ecosystem. Coming to terms with what are sometimes abstract numbers (500 ppm CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), seemingly small numbers (2°C) and the focus on the arbitrary future time of 2100 has been a wild ride. After all, on initial inspection, 2100 is over 80 years away, and we can rarely tell the difference if one day was 2°C hotter than the last. However, not only are the impacts of climate chaos already starting to hit us but even just a 2°C increase in average temperatures across the world is 1) a wildly optimistic/lucky outcome at our current rate of green house gas emissions and 2) unevenly distributed in a way that can destabilize ecosystems and the economies that rely on them. There is a very tangible risk, based on our current trajectory, that climate chaos or our radical attempts to combat it, will completely shift how the globalized economy and globalized civilization will be, before the end of this century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In short, the world ‘as we know it’ will end.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Observing the Context&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, this end is not the death of humanity per se; but it is the end of our current relationship to the earth, of current economics, consumption, and energy. This end, of course, will be a ‘new beginning’; one that we either have made by choice, managing to maintain or deepen our civilizational complexity, or a situation where we are fighting a rear-guard action against the decay and loss of the civilizational complexity that we once had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ‘new beginning’ it will stem either from 1) a radical transformation of society and the global economy (‘transformation by choice’) or 2) ‘transformation by collapse’, forced upon us by systemic failures of economies and societies across the globe (bought on by ecosystem collapse, more frequent ‘natural’ disasters/harvest failures, and increasing competition for resources/water/land). Forecasts need specific conditions, distinct time limits and numeric probabilities in order for them to be fairly evaluated/judged in the future. Defining what conditions meet the the-world-as-we-know-it-will-end criteria is not very specific with my description so far but I can offer some initial time limits and defined possibilities to begin with, and over the coming years, we will see how these forecasts update as more data comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin, the chance of the-world-as-we-know-it-will-end if we stick to current policies is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;84% by or before 2100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;69% by or before 2090&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;55% by or before 2080&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;44% by or before 2070&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;34% by or before 2060&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;25% by or before 2050&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;18% by or before 2040&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12% by or before 2030&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are somewhat nebulous forecasts by their nature, due to the scale of factors and complexity of their inter-relation; they are certainly not built up from the ground level on quantified data at the moment. Primarily they integrate the ‘transformation by choice’ and the less desirable ‘transformation by collapse’ outcomes. I am rating the likelihood of radical transformation by choice as low throughout the whole century, decreasing as we approach the end of the century. Largely because it is systematically challenging to achieve, and then later in the century, even if we earnestly attempt it, there is a high risk it will be too late to avoid ‘transformation by collapse’ anyway (although still worth it to soften the blow). Getting every major polluting nation to radically shift their behavior, requires practically each of them to come to that place via their internal politics (since international coordination continues to be sorely hampered). It’s a lot of separate battles that need to be won, and we are still in a serious hole if even a handful continue to pollute. This &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; be mitigated if other polluters go beyond zero net emissions to significant net negative emissions. ‘Transformation by collapse’ encapsulates a network of interconnected outcomes; famine from multiple ‘breadbasket’ failures, conflicts over resources, ecosystem failure, large scale geopolitical conflicts going ‘hot’, higher frequency of ‘natural’ disasters, migration/displacement pressures triggered by all of the above. The criteria for ‘transformation by collapse’ is the partial or full failure of the international political and economic order; a sustained break-down in globalized trade (including prolonged global depression); sustained break-down in globalized political stability or a large proportion (50%+) of the world in sustained conflict and/or sustained economic depression. These factors would lead us to a drop in civilizational complexity, where we would lose many of the specializations required to sustain our highest technologies and coordination efforts (such as multinational trade and coordination). &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, ‘transformation by technical salvation’ is also factored in, integrated into the ‘transformation by choice’ outcomes. Geo-engineering schemes tend to require serious resources, with a mix of projected pay-offs and the challenges of elusive international cooperation (but I still would not discount the possibility of a well-resourced actor from trying; eg China dumping tons of iron oxide into distant seas). Similarly, ‘no transformation but no problems’ outcomes (if we really whiffed on the science or modelling) are accounted as a very low chance (x &amp;#x3C; 1%). We have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-do-climate-models-work&quot;&gt;fairly sizeable handle on the major mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; at play here, including on the blind-spots of the models, and it is unlikely there is some unknown planetary buffer that will magically stop greenhouse effects from contributing to warming and destabilizing the climate. If anything, it seems more likely that we will find new ways that climate systems are being destabilized when we uncover new gaps in our understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I would break this overall forecast down into a series of more defined and discrete forecasts, (&lt;a href=&quot;https://aiimpacts.org/evidence-on-good-forecasting-practices-from-the-good-judgment-project-an-accompanying-blog-post/&quot;&gt;one of the many tips coming out of forecasting science&lt;/a&gt;). These would be used to refine the overall forecast and to update it over time. I may yet find time to delve deeper into a full forecasting project. I have recently read up on various topics around climate modeling, the carbon cycle, the glaciation cycle, negative emission technologies, questions around methane’s role, and more. Each of these could be worthwhile sources of forecasting questions. As a lazy but researched proxy, I can use the periodic IPCC models to gauge how countries are performing now and what projected average global temperature will result. The next IPCC report (6th generation) is due out 2021 but some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-why-results-from-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-matter&quot;&gt;preliminary modelling is available&lt;/a&gt;. It does not look good for those wanting to avoid collapse. The new modeling predicts 2.8°C to 5.8°C of warming by 2100, compared to the 2014 5th generation modeling, which predicted 2.1°C to 4.7°C. To be clear, even warming at the lower end of those scales could be destabilizing enough to result in ‘transformation by collapse’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One compact data point that illustrates our situation starts with the analysis that we were due to enter a glaciation period in the coming millennium. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/529162a&quot;&gt;Ganopolski et al&lt;/a&gt; model that without human agricultural practices, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; would have only been 240 parts per million around 1800, before the onset of industrialization. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at 240 ppm would have seen the return of a glaciation period, given the known and predictable changes to earth’s orbit. However, human activity pre-industrialization had already boosted CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to 280 ppm, enough to delay the onset of the next glaciation period by at least 50,000 years. At 240 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ppm, Glaciation would slowly (over 10,000 to 20,000 years) lead to an ice age, with average surface temperature reductions of 8-12°C. Today, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is over 415 ppm and increasing, the highest concentration it has been in 8 million years. An extra 40 ppm, if stretched over ten to twenty thousand years, would have allowed us to skip an ice age. We are now 135 ppm over that ‘avoid the next ice age’ level and this amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (and other greenhouse gases) in the air will slingshot us into significant warming in the near-term (this century), even if we stopped all human emissions today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what courses of action are left for individuals, communities and larger political entities that are open to understanding our predicament? Since sitting with my partner, developing our own plans, I continue to return to a few encompassing concepts that help me categorize how folks are orienting themselves to the big picture. This in turn informs and interacts with how one is orientated, and what courses of actions are available to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The two main concepts I return to are “Big Civilization” and “Little Civilization”.&lt;/strong&gt; In essence, “Big Civ” represents the continuation (via maintenance, transformation and salvation) of our globalized, urbanized, industrialized way of life. And “Little Civ” represents whatever can be held on to in a world that is increasingly destructured; deglobalized, deurbanized, deindustrialized, and in worse case scenarios, depopulated. A world that requires much more self-sufficiency, where the level of civilizational complexity has dropped from a prior high. “Big Civ” and “Little Civ” are orientations that can be applied to other civilizational crisis: the threat of nuclear war or world war; global pandemics; general threats of economic instability arising from inequality; an asteroid forecast to hit earth in 50 years time; you name it. For this post and most of my thinking around these orientations, I am focusing on climate chaos as the crisis at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Big Civilization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Big Civ” is built on the assumption or hope and optimism that 1) Things are fine/great the way they are 2) things are not great but we can turn it around, and 3) things are bad but if we really dig in, we can still turn things around. “Turning it around” in a climate context boils down to a range of interventions that involve green house gas emission reductions, coordinated political action and/or savvy innovation. Many of the IPCC’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-integrated-assessment-models-are-used-to-study-climate-change&quot;&gt;integrated assessment models&lt;/a&gt; (IAMs), are projected pathways to lower or limit warming by the end of the century; examples of efforts to save “Big Civ”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For individuals and organizations, there are things that ‘make sense’ based on the forever continuation of “Big Civilization” (assuming you can do more than just survive): Building your retirement savings; Investing in high-demand skill-sets in a globalized economy, such as software engineering, law, medicine or finance; buying urban property; going back to university for a masters; mortgages, savings, banking services; assuming there will be someone who can afford to rent or sell your investment property to in the future; building your social media ‘brand’; out-sourcing as much as you can to the market (cleaning, cooking, maintenance, etc); buying stocks; building businesses based on tourist dollars; and much more. This is not dependent on explicit reasoning; often it can simply be the linear extrapolation of how things are today.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Little Civilization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Little Civ” is a mindset that springs from beliefs or assumptions such as 1) things will not last the way things are 2) Even if we started trying to “turn things around”, there might be a long period before we get things under control and return to “normalcy” 3) It is too late to truly turn things around. Again, this mindset does not have to be based on explicit reasoning, and has existed well before our climate challenge. Arguably “preppers” are the most well-known believers of the “Little Civ” mindset, without needing a shared civilizational crisis they are all preparing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, there are things that ‘make sense’ based on the risk or ‘inevitability’ that things are going to fall apart: developing food/water/power self-sufficiency; relying more on local economies; making emergency action plans for crisis moments; focusing social bonds in your immediate community; building city plans to host refugees; building up stocks of emergency supplies; taking resources out of the global economy and investing locally. Examples specifically from a climate perspective include: building sea walls to protect bays against rising water levels; moving housing away from flood/fire/storm areas; and numerous adaptions of the generic “Little Civ” &lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the courses of action that individuals, communities and organizations will consider taking are shaped by their own orientations (explicit or not) around “Big Civ” and “Little Civ”. Additionally when considering collective action, sensible actors should also identify and consider the orientations of other actors; what mindsets are others bringing into their decision-making? To be explicit, if a collective action makes sense in one orientation but not another, it is an uphill struggle to get folks that hold different orientations to invest in the collective action; There needs to be some alignment on orientation for that to even be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, while I am talking about climate chaos and its impact on how folk take on “Big Civ” or “Little Civ” orientations, these orientations are separate from climate issues: One can orient as “Little Civ” because one believes, for example, that a civil war, zombie outbreak, religious rapture, alien invasion or nuclear war are just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before moving on to some nuances though, I want to state some broad assertions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most of us (myself included) are currently anchoring our actions from a “Big Civ” orientation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For that majority, considering “Little Civ” as an orientation can feel like facing death; the death of our world-orientation, our world-frame. Climate chaos is increasingly forcing folk to face the possibility that “Big Civ” will unravel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This felt sense of ‘facing death’ can drive us to denial, nihilism and fatalism, with two common varieties: we build elaborate rationalizations for how the scientific consensus is either a hoax, wrong or not as bad as it seems; or we acknowledge the consensus and then avoid reading about it or thinking about the future, often with background sense of gnawing dread. Jem Bendell’s paper on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lifeworth.com/deepadaptation.pdf&quot;&gt;‘Deep Adaptation’&lt;/a&gt; is one of the first and most succinct explorations of these reactions I have encountered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If “Little Civ” futures are possible, than this denial will stop us from preparing for them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;A few nuances&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Little Civ” and “Big Civ” do not capture the whole range of big-picture orientations. They &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the main thrust of this piece but there are two other orientations that encompass a range of other behaviors and mindsets that are necessary to flesh out the overall model. These two other useful orientations are “Survival” and “Next Civilization”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Survival&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging “Survival” as an orientation is acknowledging that there are many folk in the current system that are mentally or materially in a survival situation, where their behavior, thinking and actions are short-term, constrained and reactionary. Example populations in “Survival” orientation include: refugees, subsistence farmers in famine areas, folks impacted by natural disasters, some workers stripped of jobs via the globalized economy, some folks in highly oppressed social groups, some folks in dire poverty in industrialized countries, and some ‘wage slaves’. These groups are less able to control or shape their fate. Note, each individual in these groups will face their own battle with slipping into “Survival” mode when their external conditions degrade; Some of them manage to maintain agency or a broader orientation. Globally, the “Survival” population exist as a challenge for societies today, one that we are largely failing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Next Civilization&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Next Civilization” is a catch-all; for those orientations that are yearning for the next thing, beyond “Big Civ”. These orientations are united in seeing flaws in the current “Big Civilization” and seek to replace or evolve past it with a different, “better” paradigm. “Better” here is self-defined by the adherents of different forms of “Next Civ”, and can easily be in opposition to one another. Examples of “Next Civ” include decentralized crypto-currency adherents, meta-modernists, radical christian theologists, misogynist white supremacists, actual socialists (not just mislabeled social democrats) and a host of others. Many “Transformation by choice” climate outcomes would be deeply entwined with environmentally focused “Next Civ” ideas, and other “Next Civ” ideas would arguably be distractions from avoiding climate-related collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How we arrive at an orientation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For most of us, what mix of “Big Civ”, “Little Civ” and other orientations one carries comes down to our processing of life-experiences, desires, risk, fear, community, and the narratives and tidbits of information we absorb through conversations and media (all medias: social, news, academic, entertainment, etc). While there will always be a subconscious processing aspect of our civilizational orientation, researching, gaining awareness and forming forecasts are ways we can be more explicit and precise about our orientation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winter break planning and research session certainly pushed my partner and I to face the higher possibility of “Little Civilization” futures. My implicit orientation previously would have been a mix of implicit “Big Civ” and various explicit strands of “Next Civ”. Since before voting age, I had a sober understanding of the significant reluctance of governments, societies and “the market” to effectively address climate matters, despite legitimate successes such as the Montreal Protocol on CFCs. “Big Civilization” almost did address the climate challenge, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html&quot;&gt;in the 1980s&lt;/a&gt; but we fumbled and haven’t come as close since. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I have not seriously appreciated in the past was the translation of numbers like “2-3 degrees of warming by 2100” into tangible impacts over this century, nor did I have an appreciation of how there were legitimate risks of even higher levels of warming by 2100. While I am still invested in “Big Civ” avoiding collapse (largely because a disorganized, rapid lowering of civilizational complexity will drive dramatic suffering and loss of life), considering how I can prepare for “Little Civilization” scenarios is now part of my decision-making hedges regarding the future. I expect this to change over the coming years, for better or for worse, depending on how the planet and humanity collectively responds to this human-created climate challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, hedging one’s orientation begets trade-offs; how do we decide how to split our focus, resources and time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What hedges I am personally making ultimately come down to where I am now in my life, and how that tracks against the opportunities to transform society and the risk of collapse. As I have mentioned above, if transformation by choice (heading to a net negative carbon society) is going to happen, it has to happen soon; within the next 15 years at the latest due to the amount of green house gases we have already pumped into the atmosphere. Politically and financially, I will continue to look for the best opportunities to push for that outcome in the context of “Big Civ”; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.catf.us/donate/&quot;&gt;Changing government policy&lt;/a&gt;, movement building, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twicefire.com/summerschool/&quot;&gt;making cities more sustainable&lt;/a&gt;, experiments in climate technology, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rainforestcoalition.org/&quot;&gt;supporting coordinating bodies&lt;/a&gt; as a sample. Beyond that, I will be researching, and where appropriate, investing in other masteries and knowledge that is more useful in a “Little Civ” context. Soil restoration, reforestation, permaculture, precision ag, disaster preparation, food preservation, landscaping, gardening, water management, do-it-yourself skills, are all example topics/masteries. And especially; the prospects of community building for and during hard-times. It is certain that at least some of this research/effort will be a dead-end, and there is a risk that any particular topic will not be optimal use of my time. However, it will all go into my attempt at hedging options for future possibilities, to be somewhat prepared for later action if required. And, to continue to regulate my balance between different civilizational outlooks, I need to carve out times and conditions for updating my forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Updating: Risk Factors and Leverage Points&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this decade progresses, I will be periodically allocating time to update my forecasts (at least every three years). In my current forecasts, there are chunks of uncertainty; how will humanity respond? We are not sure about the impact of factor X, will get more data or become more certain? How are we tracking against Paris agreement targets? How is the data tracking against the models?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separate from this post, I am compiling a compendium of links, articles, arguments, and data related to climate chaos and my forecasts. I will want to ear-mark certain data points and theories, that need to be revisited and assessed as time (hopefully) reveals more data and insight. Some of these markers are metrics for civilizational well-being. Others are markers for non-linear change risks. Below is a sample list of aspects I am tracking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Whether the proportion of the globe in “Survival” mode is increasing or decreasing (difficult to qualitatively assess)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is happening with deforestation in Brazil, and the Amazon’s ecology in general&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is happening with big emitters/consumers, particularly the USA, China and Europe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is happening with arctic ice, glaciers and other land-based ice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Methane, and whether we have tracked down its unexplained emissions growth (&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2019/06/industrial-methane-emissions-are-underreported-study-finds&quot;&gt;maybe it is just systemic under-reporting&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large Power conflict&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Negative emissions technology; innovation, adoption and success (or lack thereof)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geo-engineering; adoption/rejection/breakthroughs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nuclear power; adoption/rejection/breakthroughs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Introduction and effectiveness of carbon taxes/credits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are nations &lt;a href=&quot;https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/&quot;&gt;tracking against their Paris Agreement commitments&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What will the future look like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every movie or story of the future has some mix of Big, Little, Survival and Future civ in it. And they are all wrong, in the sense that that isn’t how the future will be. While I might illustrate hypothetical futures in later posts, that cannot be because I think that is how things will go down. But such hypotheticals might be useful for folks that are struggling to envision what might occur in specific contexts. Since we are largely familiar with “Big Civ”, future examples are likely to be Little Civ focused or hybrids. I hope any readers of this post will have a new model to assess how folks are orienting around climate chaos and a redoubled curiosity about how we can work to both avoid collapse and prepare for its possibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Into the Long Night]]></title><description><![CDATA[At the start of the month, my older youth group ventured out on our overnight challenge: 12 hours overnight hike, from sunset to sun rise…]]></description><link>https://twicefire.com/ritesofpassage/overnightmttam/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://twicefire.com/ritesofpassage/overnightmttam/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2019 15:11:55 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the start of the month, my older youth group ventured out on our overnight challenge: 12 hours overnight hike, from sunset to sun rise, around and up Mt Tam, over 18 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had been building up the overnight challenge hike with the boys for months now; we shared that it might push each of us to different limits around the cold, possibly the wet, the lack of sleep, the distance we were hiking, the darkness and the extra challenge that comes from navigating at night. It was easier to get lost, easier to get grumpy, easier for discomfort to arise. And there was also some magic to be found; watching a sunset and keeping our watch over the world until the sun returned. That was the Long Night we were facing and venturing forth into. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started at Pantoll campground and set out up the hill, to find a vantage point for sunset. As we hiked up, we found that the rest of the world was disappearing below us; the fog was wrapping the entire bay up in its embrace. It was awe-inspiring to be standing on one of the little ‘islands’, jutting out above the fog, and looking out on to that white fluffy ‘ocean’. We got some photos and then after a brief council (the boys were a little too riled up to really sit in it), we set out into the night. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a moonless night, with much of the city light blocked by the fog, so the sky was amazing. On the Potrero Meadows trail, Chaise and I held back for a moment to see when/if the boys would notice we had stopped. They did stop, finally quieting themselves to take in the frogs croaking, the stars above and the presence of the forest that surrounded the meadow, as Chaise and I caught up to them. Our little food break there easily slide into a star-gazing moment, with many constellations, satellites, aircraft and even the occasional shooting star making an appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we continued into the night, a few patterns started to emerge in the group. A ‘speed squad’ or ‘fast gang’ emerged; always pushing ahead of the rest of the group, like they had somewhere to be. This group also included ‘the navigator’, one of the youth who had gotten the idea into their head that they knew what path we should be taking to go where, and strongly petitioned anyone in earshot about which turn we should take next (which was, comically, wrong 80% of the time). This led to some ‘fun’ (in retrospect) yo-yoing of the group, with some wrong turns, missed turns (that we didn’t see) and “oops, we have to go back the way we came”. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After one of these turn-arounds, we found ourselves at the base of a formidable uphill ‘trail’ that was a seemingly never-ending steep rock-scramble, flanked on both sides by a thicket of mountain brush. It was past midnight and we were close to the East peak of Mt Tam. It was &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of work to get up that rock face, the sort of effort where you just become fixated on putting the next step up the hill, one after another. After an endless time of that, we reached a clearing in the brush, and a natural rest-point on a rocky outcrop on the left of the path. And wow. Without realizing the magnitude of it all, we were just transported into another world. We were alone in this world, separated from everything else by this thick blanket of fog. The last distinguishable lights of civilization could be seen just below us but soon those too were enveloped in the fog. The glow of civilization lit up parts of this fog blanket in a hazey glow but I think the only remaining reminders of humanity were the faint lights on Sutro tower and the very rare aircraft taking off from one of the airports. I think we might have stayed there for something like an hour, just taking in the stars, watching the fog flow like a slow-motion waterfall around parts of the bay and listening to some music while we relaxed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the night was our return to the light and civilization. It was harder on our bodies, the light banter from earlier in the night died down and we pressed on in a determined fashion. Chaise and I positioned ourselves at the front and back of the group and set the pace for much of this time, working in short water breaks as we pushed through the night. At around 4:30 AM, the speed squad finally broke past me and charged up one of the final ascends (to our sun-rise spot). We checked out the Mountain Theatre, an outdoor theatre (currently hosting a production of “Grease”). We stopped at the very top of the seating, for a break. The lads wanted to go climb on the stage but we suggested we should just get moving to our final sun-rise spot. By this time, we had descended into the fog, so we could barely see the stage. As we were making to leave, an eerily light shone towards us from the stage! It was quite faint (in the fog) and quite spooky but we had probably disturbed someone from the production that was sleeping on the stage! Sorrrry!!! We quickly hiked off to our last destination, the same spot where we had watched the sunset the day before.
Well… We had been so incredibly lucky with the fog for the rest of the evening. But not for sunrise! It was completely lost in the mist and after some shivering and waiting, we marched down the hill for our last council of the hike. I would say about 18 miles of hiking in the end. We realized it was the last time we would see each other until September on our SUMMER TRIP! Wow, that snuck up on me fast! Thankfully the lads have all jumped on a messaging thread and are trying to melt our phones by sending everyone a hundred meme pictures a day… So hopefully we’ll stay in touch over that time :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of creating a special and challenging experience in a profound setting, this hike was beyond expectations. I know it will be a experience that will stay with me and with each of us in the group, for a long time. In terms of linking it to a deeper sense of reflection and delving into that in a group field; it felt a bit lacking there. The group energy was buzzing early on, making it hard for our council to hold any depth. And then once we were on the hike, the focus on the process of hiking and finding where we were, and then just the straight up exhaustion was not conducive to structured reflection. I wish we had a evening meeting after the daylong to reflect on it in more depth, and hear more about each other’s experiences of the Long Night. Hopefully we can still reach back into our experiences and reflect when we come back together after summer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;My books of summer 2019 and why&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;China&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China plays a huge role in global affairs, and will continue to do so for the rest of the 21st century. I want to continue adding to my understanding and impressions of this huge entity. I have already wolfed down two of Ma Jian’s brutal dissident fictions, &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2IvaLJd&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Road&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2DkAIac&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beijing Coma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Hoping to round out those brillant, dark, and desperate reflections of the brutality of modern China with these next three works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Empire, history and “Civilization”&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world as we know it today has been shaped by countless events and moments in history. However we perceive or understand different places and societies today, one can almost always peel off another layer and discover the deeper lines and forces at play. These books represent the current smattering of works in that vein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Society, community and belonging&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four books represent different facets of how humans come together and interact. &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZmmWxm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liars and Outliers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is actually going to be a re-read. I read it when it first came out. I’ll probably take the time over summer to write up a review/prior on some of the key concepts from it that I have held on to over these years. &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2DhRg2z&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scale&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; popped up as a good option for complex systems thinking and seeing the common patterns that pop up in various systems. Good general prep for the &lt;a href=&quot;www.twicefire.com/summerschool&quot;&gt;sustainability summer school&lt;/a&gt; I’m heading to in July. &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2ZmyUHp&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Art of Gathering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will hopefully yield some gems on how to cultivate and grow community. And &lt;em&gt;Towards Self-sufficiency&lt;/em&gt; attempts to map out a model for resilient communities, ready to survive the coming ‘transition’ as the global economy and ecology collapses; Cheery stuff!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: An old mentor recommended this book to me. It overlaps with much of my work and learnings with Stepping Stones but also comes with a strong Australian flavour. I feel strongly about the topics touched on in the book but recognize I have much to learn about the work and different angles being taken around it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are men who wake up in the morning energised and happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whose partners and children love and trust them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who do work they believe in and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have loyal and interesting friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And are deeply involved in the wider world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They may not be famous or wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They value something quite different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are learning how to be real.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First published in 1994, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GZ56VY7/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;#x26;camp=1789&amp;#x26;creative=9325&amp;#x26;creativeASIN=B07GZ56VY7&amp;#x26;linkCode=as2&amp;#x26;tag=twicefire-20&amp;#x26;linkId=70a465d2c0eefab8010391427ce66413&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Manhood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (back then just &lt;em&gt;Manhood&lt;/em&gt;) and Steve Biddulph’s consistent touring and writing have touched the lives of countless men in Australia. Steve begins the book with an anecdote tinged with an quintessential Australian male flavour. Steve describes experiencing the tension and flutter of the moments before public speaking. He pops into the foyer, to smooth some of his nerves by chatting and being with some of the folk coming to listen to his talk. He notices a fellow intently staring at him; a big muscular, tattooed bloke, in a singlet top and with a beard for good measure. As this man noticed Steve noticing him, he gathers his two companions and strides purposefully up to Steve, stopping within inches of Steve’s face. Frowning, the man speaks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You been following me around?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve understandably is confounded by this confrontational tack and breathlessly mouths a non-reply before the man puts him out of his misery; breaking into a wide grin, the man continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That bloody book of yours - that’s the story of my life, mate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension broken, the man goes on to introduce his brother and father, and explains how they had barely spoken for years until he had read &lt;em&gt;Manhood&lt;/em&gt;, sent copies to them and then they had collectively ‘sorted it out’. Its a beautiful, tangible moment for Steve and some of the men he has helped heal. It is also deeply powerful for me, feeling the dry Australian humour of how the man approached Steve (and my nostalgic yearning for such humour) but more so hearing about how this man and his family-men, very ‘blokey’ embodiments of Australian masculinity, had been reached by Steve Biddulph’s work. This gives me hope, assaying one of my fears around contemporary work on masculinity; that it can come off as unaccessible and completely alien to lots of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Manhood&lt;/em&gt; (updated twice more since 1994) rolls on from there. Biddulph defines the challenge men face today, and methodically works through the different arenas of family, love, work and meaning that is bound up in it all. For this review, I want to focus on a couple of key areas that either stood out for me or are connected to the rites of passage work I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The River of Masculinity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While delving into the challenge faced by contemporary masculinity, Biddulph makes use of the metaphor of the “River of Masculinity”. The river here represents the handing on of wisdom from men to boys; the preparation that boys go through to join society as adults. It represents the rites of passage, initiations, apprenticing and skill-sharing that tribes, or villages would go through to prepare male youth for sustaining the community. It flows like a river, from generation to generation, over the millennia.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biddulph makes the case that this river has been interrupted. Specifically, he cites the advent of industrialization as the main cause of this, while also noting the impact of global conflicts such as WWII. For me, this also links to industrialization’s parallel processes of urbanization and globalization, a notion that I touched on in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twicefire.com/summerschool&quot;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt;. This disruption has largely been self-inflicted for most industrialized societies. Biddulph does not dwell heavily on all the different ways the river has been diverted/dammed/blocked/disrupted; the core concept is that change/disruption has occurred and societies have not adapted sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dropping in two references early in the book, Biddulph does not explicitly reference this ‘river of masculinity’ again. It is not, for example, included in the index. I want to explore the metaphor a little deeper and link it to some other aspects of society and masculinity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Down the river…&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, the metaphor implies that there is stability and continuity when the river flows strongly. This should not be taken as a positive value judgment on the practices that are passed down via this flow. While the stability and continuity of these ‘rivers’ is largely missing from industrialized societies, the contents of those rivers no doubt included (or still includes) limiting ideas and concepts that we want to let go of. There is much to gain from understanding how societies functioned in the past and whether we are really addressing the developmental needs of our youth; however the solution is not to try to paddle up the river to a prior time. We must learn and integrate from the past, while forging a new future. I think Biddulph’s work would agree with this sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Disrupting the river as a means of subjugation&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reflection that came up for me is that the interruption of some rivers of masculinity has been a very deliberate act of disruption during colonialism, war, and conflict. European and other imperial and colonial ambitions have repeatedly disrupted the flow of the river in other societies, whether via literal killings, through to slavery, genocide, forced removal of children, banning of cultural practices, or encouraging drug dependency (often dove-tailed with increased criminalization, a la the USA “War on Drugs”). This attacking of the social fabric and its flow-on impacts are conveniently forgotten at times, when folks critique other societies as ‘backward’, ‘ungovernable’ and ‘failed’. This has come up strongly for me as I have just finished reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2KjeOdu&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Emu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a book that examines archaeological evidence and accounts of aboriginal societies from the writings and records of the earliest white colonists in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Reactionary confusion about the source of disruption&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think men in many societies are feeling the ebb of the river of masculinity. There are tangible senses of loneliness, disconnection, lack of belonging and meaning in many men. But only a vague sense of what is blocking the flow of the river, what the causes of it are. Of course, some men are adequately mentored and flourish. Some men manage to figure it out, and manage to self-initiate themselves in some fashion that gets them to a more holistic maturity.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many men only get part of the way there. They get by in many ways but are also stuck in some areas. And others, lose their way. A self-destructive falling off the path can look like failed attempts to self-initiate (getting into all sorts of edgy situations), self-harm/self-sabotage, mental-health challenges (including suicide), or getting fixated/addicted to coping mechanisms. Losing one’s way can also be outward looking, or socially-destructive: joining gangs in search of mentorship, belonging and initiation; adopting victim-identities and blaming ‘others’, whether its their families, women, religious minorities, queer/trans folk, immigrants, foreigners, and the like, for the disconnection experienced; and/or taking all that a step further and joining far-right and/or nihilistic groups and contributing to harassment and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Losing the way&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ‘othered’ groups can be lazy targets for men who have lost their way. Women have done extensive work to create new post-industrial possibilities for women and to otherwise reclaim their power. This is a disruption to the classic skinny social contract that men and women got out of industrialization; a gross simplification of such being “men to the public sphere and women to the home”. If one gets fixated on thinking that women’s liberation is in competition to men’s liberation, counterproductive and reactionary behaviors can soon follow. Similar patterns can apply to the existence, survival, liberation and self-actualization efforts of the other groups and identities I touched on above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Men who start falling down these paths become prime candidates for recruitment by fundamentalist militants, racial supremacists, far-right groups and other nihilistic efforts. They are the boy soldiers taught to rape as a weapon of war in the Congo; they are the Western-born men that are drawn to different flavors of stochastic terrorism. They are the foot-soldiers of ISIS; they are the white supremacists meeting in Charlottesville; they are the ‘edge-lords’ and shit-posters from 8Chan, egging on the ‘lone wolf’ mass shooters.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the context of the metaphor, these ‘lost boys’ have typically been cut off from main-stream rivers of masculinity. But it is important to acknowledge that there are, I would argue small, ‘rivers of masculinity’ that are flowing strongly, mentoring their youth into socially destructive, dogmatic world-views, such as the various forms of ethno-fascism around the world. The strength of their convictions is attractive to those who have lost their way. Reconnecting and reinventing main-stream rivers of masculinity is a critical project in neutralizing the impact of these misguided lineages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reestablishing these rivers of masculinity is not just the work of helping men self-actualize; it is the work necessary to stop those men who are at risk of totally losing their way and harming others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initiation, mentorship, other men and rites of passage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving the metaphor of the river, I want to connect &lt;em&gt;The New Manhood&lt;/em&gt; to the rites-of-passage focus of Stepping Stones. Biddulph focuses on a variety of key male relationships that shape the maturation process of men. The relationship to our fathers and immediate family is a critical one, detailed in the earliest chapters. The father-son relationship is made more critical by the preference for nuclear-family style living in industrialized nations (something worth reconsidering with how we raise youth). There is an important transition however, as youth enter their teenage years, when they need adult figures beyond their parents, to be mentors, guides and stewards. This is the main area of overlap between the &lt;em&gt;The New Manhood&lt;/em&gt; and Stepping Stones work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a specific buzzword, Biddulph does not use rites-of-passage (although he does reference a poem, &lt;em&gt;Rites of Manhood&lt;/em&gt; in his chapter about relating to women). However, the chapter “From Boy to Man” lays out a series of efforts that align with the form and content of rites-of-passage work with youth. Biddulph details three different organizations and efforts (including one called “The Rite Journey”), from Australia and Holland, and their ways of dealing with male youth in this transition phase. The two Australian accounts are school-based and involve significant intervention into one school year of the boys that go through the program. In contrast, Stepping Stones is separate from school, arcs over a longer period of time but has vastly less contact time between mentors and the youth. There are key overlapping aspects however: the inclusion of rites or  ceremonial aspects for marking the transition from child to adult life; the involvement of the family unit in this marking; the importance of building a bond between the youth and mentors; the importance of self-reflection; and the forging of a strong container and camaraderie between the boys involved in the programs. Certainly it is exciting and enlivening for me to read about other folks working with this critical rite of passage, and I am planning to research the different programs in greater depth at a later stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biddulph does not speak to directly to this developmental phase himself, largely leaving it to the examples to illustrate the importance of this time period in a boy/man’s life. Alternatively, since his other best-seller, &lt;em&gt;Raising Boys&lt;/em&gt;, (I assume) heavily encompasses this period of development, he may just be keeping his powder dry for that book!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;The Time of Ashes&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other important initiation that Biddulph covers is “The Time of Ashes”. When life goes wrong, and things turn sour, our character is truly tested and we must find our way again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are taught that adolescence is the big transition of life, as if there are no over important journey”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This moments are triggered by the inevitable challenges that life throws at us: an unexpected death in the family, the lost of a job, the end of a core-mastery, the partner that falls out of love with you, a miscarriage, a car crash, the lost of our parents… I wanted to mention this chapter (“The Journey Down”), to both honor the grief, pain and growth that comes from set-backs, if we take the time to process them, and to remind myself of the importance of all rites of passage, not just the one I am facilitating with these sets of boys. I think Stepping Stones does a great job of reminding everyone in the community that we are all constantly being initiated into new roles, and new phases of life; whether as group-leaders, elders of groups, parents or staff.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;In summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Manhood&lt;/em&gt; covers a wide range of the key aspects of ‘becoming a man’, in a fashion that can connect the ‘river of masculinity’ with the possibilities of emerging forms of positive masculinity. Biddulph closes the book with one last piece of advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a signpost. Don’t climb it, &lt;em&gt;go where it points&lt;/em&gt;. There is a larger life waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important reminder: we need to do; explore, attempt, learn, fail and repeat. In this learning, we should anticipate the emergence of multitudes of positive masculinities; there will not be a singular ‘woke’/positive masculinity that dominates and consumes all. I do not recommend Biddulph’s work to you as that singular new way to be explore masculinity but as a great enquiry into the subject, to deepen your own work. It has been a source of great reflection for me; Gratitude for the constant loving (and eccentric) presence of my father throughout my childhood, questions about my felt sense of a lack of mentorship outside a few exceptions, and further questions about the challenge of building new friendships with men. I sincerely hope you get a chance to enjoy a read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very excited about this news! I found out in early February that the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) was offering the course in July 2019 and was immediately fascinated. The course takes two of SFI’s core theme; interdisciplinary studies and complex systems studies and applies those to the relationship between cities and sustainability. I applied soon after finding out about the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I have been accepted, and am now gleefully checking the student list as folks fill out their little bios. I am very curious to see what sorts of people are going to make up our cohort and what their respective paths and journeys have been to this point. Already we have representation from India, Mexico, Jordan, Nepal, China, the USA, and other regions, with a mix of academic, public sector, and private sector folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is the course about?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2007 was the turning point at which &lt;a href=&quot;https://theconversation.com/the-worlds-urban-population-is-growing-so-how-can-cities-plan-for-migrants-49931&quot;&gt;more than half of humanity&lt;/a&gt; lived in urban settings; in cities. This urbanization has been building over the last few centuries, and is interwoven with other significant trends, such as industrialization and globalization. Cities can be thought of as complex systems, with many variables, inputs, outputs, feedback loops. This frame can be applied both to their place in a globalized society and economy, and also their internal workings with cross city movement, support systems (sewage, power, communications, etc), social life and a city’s relationship to its physical surrounds. The course certainly seeks to look at cities as complex systems and to unpick numerous aspects of their make up from a sustainability point of view. As it stands, the archetypal way of being for cities is that they are heavy coalescing points for resources and specialization, that are dependent on sucking in vast resources and people from elsewhere. This has typically occurred in an unsustainable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Why the sustainability focus for cities?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interwoven trends of urbanization, globalization and industrialization have rapidly shifted humanity’s relationship to the environment, namely through increased consumption of resources and increased strain on ecological systems as a result of human activities. The 21st century is seeing a shift in the global climate at a speed which the earth has not seen. The speed of this shift is generating climate-based chaos in ecological systems across the globe. These systems have buffers and feedback loops to maintain some level of homeostasis or stability within systems but the change is so rapid that many of these stabilizers are exhausted or at risk of failing. These failures can take years and decades to play out, longer than the typical attention span of citizens and decision-makers today but barely a blink of the age from a ecological change perspective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humanity’s current mode of being is unsustainable. Something must change, and it will change, whether we are in control of that change or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2007, the proportion of humanity living in urban settings has only increased. If we are going to reach a point where humanity can &lt;em&gt;sustain&lt;/em&gt; our population levels, we have to find ways to make cities more sustainable, since that is where the bulk of humanity has concentrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are yearnings in some circles for a full ‘return to the land’; a move away from urban settings and back to more rural ways of being. While the cultivation of our relationship to nature is often a missing part of urban life (and worthy of being addressed!), the rejection of city-life as a whole mode of being is very likely an unattainable goal for most. There is a curious (and small) intersection of peoples who are ‘privileged’ enough to be able to make this transition back ‘to the land’ (or are already there in a fashion) and reject urban life altogether. However, it is difficult for most. Cities and urban life, as the predominant way of being for humanity, need to be centered in our efforts to prevent and mitigate climate chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is drawing me to the course&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love cities. I love the energy of them, the opportunities, the richness, the diversity that is possible. I want their depth and positive aspects to continue. But they can be soul-destroying, denaturing and unsustainable. I want to see how we can save them and this course offers some interesting opportunities to explore that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to spark a shift within my company, HERE technologies, in providing geo data and services that help answer questions about sustainability and cities. The institutional inertia I am up against is sizable but I will have a crack at it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another pull is to meet, be inspired by and support all the other people draw to this course. To strengthen my own path towards addressing climate chaos and to help others on their own paths in regards to that. Obviously I will take a geospatial angle on the various problem sets we encounter. But I also hope to share my experiences with rites of passage, nature and other more social and societal aspects of this challenge space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also very plainly excited to return to New Mexico. The area around Taos and Santa Fe is a special one. And I hear Meow Wolf has a new story-line!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly, I consider myself part of the privileged group that might be able to have a go at getting away from the globalized interdependency of city-life. I have sufficient resources, skills and inclination to make a decent crack at it if I so chose to do so at some point in the future. Regardless of whether I do or not, the importance of how effective we are at making cities sustainable will have huge implications for my own life, that of my children and of the fate of humanity and much of the earth’s current bio-diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I enter into the final year with my first Stepping Stones youth group, I have decided to take on another. This is my commitment to the importance I place on mentoring and modelling positive masculinities to boys as they are coming of age. But how does rites of passage relate to that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the core beliefs of the Stepping Stones Project is that many industrialized societies/communities have let go of or forgotten collective rites of passage for youth, for the time period when they transition from childhood to adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inherent in this belief is the forgotten importance of rites of passage; a collective way for us to mark and acknowledge the maturation process of youth, as they transition into later stages of development. This marking of maturation, and the role-modeling and mentoring that are bound up with it, can provide a crucial role in helping folk ‘find their place’, in their families, communities, or universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping Stones use the concept of the ‘broken village’ to encapsulate the narrative of the letting go of youth rites of passage. For most of human civilization, the prototypical ‘way of life’ has largely revolved around the social group the size of a village. In our modern context, that sizing of social group is largely ‘broken’ over time and space. Our social time and attention tends to be split over a larger quantity of people, a larger area and without as much consistency over time. The innovation of ‘cities’ has resulted in many positive and negative disruptions in how humans have experienced their ‘way of life’, and the role of ‘city-life’ is related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the qualities of the ‘broken village’ model:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We live in greater density of people and structures,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This density means we know and rely on our immediate neighbors vastly less,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The density tends to be co-located with the exclusion of nature; leading to a disassociation from nature and also our own bodies,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is less and less inter-generational co-location; we tend to be geographical separated from our blood families,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These factors have come together to interrupt the prototypical developmental flow that existed in past ‘village’ life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some flow on implications from this simple model include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feelings of trust, safety and belonging are harder to maintain/generate in larger groups;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The increased alienation from nature and our bodies tends towards a spiritual or metaphysical alienation; feelings of ‘rootlessness’, isolation and loneliness seep in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While cities create diverse opportunities for communities to emerge around more fringe pursuits, creating new ways of belonging and connection, they have tended to not fully address all our social needs.

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;This all might read as me being a big downer on cities. I am not, I love them and think they have lots of interesting trade-offs. Just not wanting to tangent into all that&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stepping Stones Project sees rites of passage as a crucial vehicle by which to address these interwoven challenges, and our specific program as one effort in returning rites of passage to modern life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization focuses on the rite of passage that marks the transition from childhood to adolescence. But there is a network effect to how the organization integrates the leaders, youth, families-of-youth and elders into this process. Groups include two co-leaders and an elder, striving to close the inter-generational gap. Initiation is the recurring theme with rites of passage; as we initiate the youth into young adulthood, the leaders and elders are being initiated into new roles and responsibilities, as mentors and wisdom-sharers. The life of the group also seeks to involve parents in their own initiation; coming into being a parent for a young adult. An experience that is decidedly different than being the parent of a ‘kid’. These initiations, if marked and witnessed, can also be seen as rites of passage for new or different phases of our adult lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is ultimately in service of maturation, across generations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marking and noting these transitions and maturations is vital to an individual’s integration of them. The more we can return that to our lives, the more we will be able to collectively and individually navigate the challenges ahead of us. To loop us back to the initial spark of this piece, I’m looking forward to introducing another collection of families to this rite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is hard to pinpoint when we lost Gerald. He had been a member of our three year ‘rite of passage’ youth group from the very beginning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steppingstonesproject.org/&quot;&gt;(run through the Stepping Stones Project)&lt;/a&gt;. In someway, all the boys were ‘lost’ when they joined the group; we all are in some fashion at that age. Transitioning from the relatively simple perspective of a child, to life as a young adult, is a wild ride for most folks. Finding most of the boys took time. We  faced disruption over much of the groups existence: the wild energy of the group, boys leaving the group as a consequence of that (both disruptor and disruptees); more boys joining the group; my first co-leader leaving the group, and the transition to Chaise, my current co-leader. Gerald brought a subtle mischievous angle into the group over this time; deflections away from deeper questioning, rambolic stories in response to council prompts, ‘bonding’ that involved trolling/heckling group members past their limits. However he was not so dissimilar from the other boys that have found their peace within the group. &lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major purpose of the group is to hold the youths’ experiences, whatever that may be. This includes their nascent social patterns, with the hope we can allow them to be comfortable enough to reflect on those patterns in a group context. If one of the youth has some social anxiety or a relating challenge, and have formed disruptive strategies for dealing with that, the length of the group (several years) is meant to allow for this dynamic to be worked through, instead of just shutting it down and smothering it. We have made that transition with the rest of the boys in the group (not to suggest that they’ve come to terms with their challenges!). And due to a mix of circumstances, it did not work out for Gerald in the time we had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the group was collectively dropping in deeper together over the last year, Gerald was not budging. It was difficult to see at first, but in the last half of 2018, it became more obvious. I noticed some anxiety come up for me, when thinking about Gerald’s pace of integration. We had our ‘summer trip’ booked for early October 2018 (on my birthday and anniversary weekend; another story, don’t let me start…). I knew that trip would be so critical for all the boys, getting them to land more fully into the group. Gerald had missed one of the two trips from our first year, something that he had jokingly turned into a bit of a complex, ‘forbidding’ discussion or references to group adventures he had missed out on. For all the boys and for Gerald in particular, I was waiting for that October trip to bond us together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around this time, Gerald had started at a new high school, of his choice. This turned out to be a decisive factor. It is a very academically focused school. Very rapidly, the pressure Gerald was placing on himself to crush academically was apparent. We started getting calls and messages from his parents that he was stressing about coming to the group; he wanted to finish his homework. We learnt that it was not uncommon for him to stay up past midnight, finishing his homework and then waking up at 6:30 am to get to school on time the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing that, I was totally aghast; How could 30+ hours of homework per week be sustainable or reasonable for any teenager?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rushed to look up what reasonable levels of homework were: there is a mix of views on the validity of homework but no one was recommending anything near that level of time spent. I made my fear and concern about Gerald’s situation known to his parents. They shared my concerns and added some more detail: a large proportion of that homework was optional. It was Gerald’s fear of ‘falling behind’ that was diving him to grind away at every piece. Gerald homework trap was largely self-inflicted. :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a double whammy for Gerald’s participation in the group; he would miss meetings because he was sick from the stress he was under, or just not show up if he felt too far behind on homework. And when he did show up, he was exhausted, irritated and otherwise under-resourced to deal with his social anxiety. And to top it off, he ended up getting very sick just before the summer trip, something he was already very stressed about due to the time-off he would have to take from assignments and homework. He did not make it on the trip, yet another great bonding experience for the group that Gerald had missed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerald’s journey over this time had been in stark contrast to that of the other boys in the group. With the richness of our trip to Bodega, with the fire vigil, wind-swept hill, and kayak adventure, and the continued dipping into council, the rest of the group have relaxed into a more open way of sharing with one another. The new phase for the group, of being able to slow down and take life in has been such a blessing. This, regrettably, was not how things were for Gerald. Sharing vulnerably was unbearable for him, as he continued to be trapped in his social anxiety. His coping mechanisms for these times were… disruptive, to say the least. We tried to give applicable feedback to the group and Gerald specifically, about the limits we had for disruption, over those six months. Unfortunately, it just was not landing for Gerald. As 2018 wound down, the question of what to do with Gerald only got louder, especially when our ropes course day long, another key opportunity to bond with the group, was cancelled because of the wildfire smoke blanketing the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This question hung over the group during the holiday break and was right on the agenda in the first fire circle of 2019, with the wider Stepping Stones community (leaders, elders and staff). The tension I was holding about Gerald’s situation was very present at this meeting. As we went around the circle for everyone’s initial check-in and role for the evening, I posed my role for the evening as the ‘questioner’, pondering what to do about Gerald. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the talking piece was passed to Chaise for his check-in, he described his role as the ‘humane executioner’. I immediately knew what he meant; removing Gerald from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Chaise named that ‘role’, the reality of my deep resistance to that idea was finally uncovered. As the fire circle meeting continued, along with additional little moments of dialogue and reflection about this, this reality, of the need to remove Gerald, was fully dawning on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important aspect of fire circles is peer-counsel: asking for advice and wisdom from the wider Stepping Stones community. I felt time running down, without us dropping into counsel. A key community member, someone I really wanted to hear our challenge and provide wisdom, left early. My anxiety about whether we were even going to have time to fit in counsel was building: I had to speak up as we transitioned from one activity to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I surfaced by concern about time and not getting to counsel, and shared that I was holding a lot of tension around what we needed to share with the circle. The circle facilitators assured me that we were going to go into counsel as the last thing before we broke for the evening. After a dyad/paired exercise, it was time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember it being our time to share about Gerald, and as I was about to speak, feeling the full force of the realization that yes, factoring in the whole context, it really felt like the only way forward was to remove Gerald from the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many emotions bubbled up and ultimately out of me in that moment. I had fought so hard to keep this group together, to make it work. I really got to know and love each of these boys; each one of them is so dearly missed by the whole group when they could not attend. Acknowledging in my heart that Gerald had to go generated great sadness in me for him, and I, at some level, felt like I was failing him by not being able to guide him to marking with the whole group. I cannot recall how much of this I covered or mentioned; I was choking up with emotion. I wanted to be present to those emotions and feel them, but also still be able to articulate myself about our problem. I acknowledged my resistance to taking Gerald out of the group and how Chaise’s comment at the start of the fire circle had pulled the veil from my eyes. I knew, with precious little time left for the group before marking, that even if a decent solution could be attempted, that we would have to reorient the entire group experience around Gerald. It felt like we had to choose between Gerald’s experience of the group and everyone elses (including our own).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It felt good to be held and counselled by that circle. Inter-generational care and wisdom were shared. Chaise got to speak his piece, less choked up than myself, and we got to consider next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We actually met with the boys two days later. Boy oh boy, did Gerald strongly reinforce the need for him to transition out of the group. We played hot-seat, where each group member would sit in the ‘hot seat’ and each of us got to ask them one question, which they had to answer truthfully or pass (if the question was too much). Gerald stalled, he cross-talked, he interjected, slowing things up. He froze when it was his chance to ask questions, he even tried to poll everyone ELSE about what question he should ask. Gerald happened to be leaving early that night, so he was hoping against hope that his departure time would arrive before he had to sit in the hot seat. Once he was the last one who had not gone up to the hot seat, he claimed that he had been the second one to go up there and thus did not need to go up there. Finally, he got up in the hot seat and we struggled through the questions asked of him… The energy of the group was shot and Gerald’s picking up of the floor mats and slinging them around became the game of the moment. As we shut that down, Gerald’s departure time came and the group collectively dropped from a frantic high to a more laid-back vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We ended up talking to Gerald on the phone the night after, thinking that his behavior was clearly a sign that things were rough with homework and that he resented even being in the group. On the call we asked him about his experience of the group; He was happy with it, and keen to continue being in the group. He seemed to have no idea that his behavior was disruptive (and his parents reiterated later that this was his sincere understanding of his behavior). Putting the phone down, I realized; we were not helping someone escape from a situation they did not want to be in. We were going to be pushing them out of a group they wanted to be a part of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arranged to meet with Gerald’s parents. Our group elder, Pat, hosted us all on a Sunday afternoon. I knew we had to get to the point of the meeting as soon as feasible. Right out, I outlined that Chaise, Pat and myself were in agreement that Gerald had to go. Gerald’s parents were heart-broken. They both were keenly aware of the challenges Gerald faced socially with his anxiety and also the pressure he was putting himself under with school. They reiterated that one of the things that drew them to Stepping Stones was the structured social space in which kids like Gerald might be able to work through the challenge of relating and attuning to others. They expressed appreciation for the care and love we showed Gerald and also some frustration that perhaps with earlier intervention, Gerald’s departure from the group would not have been inevitable. Unfortunately, we only have so much time and resources to tend to the life of the group; maybe 160 hours over the year for both co-leaders. Stepping Stones is not pitched as a space for youth who need lots of individual focus and support. This is part of the harshness we were all experiencing; we all could see how much Gerald needed support. And all recognised how the group ultimately could not contain Gerald’s challenging presence. We outlined a plan to have Gerald attend the group one last time, in a transition ceremony to mark his time with the group. A chance to give him and the boys some measure of closure about this change in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After some negotiation, preparation and time, the day arrived. The group met at our regular time but without Gerald, his parents and Pat. We had let the other boy’s parents know that Gerald was leaving the group and if any boys wanted to write something for Gerald, now was the time. We got feedback from some parents that their son was not surprised something like this was happening. While we were meeting with the rest of the group, Gerald, his parents and Pat were meeting at Pat’s place for a short renegotiation council, reflecting on their relationships as parent and child. Specifically, it was to ask about things the parents and child want to leave behind and what new things to cultivate as the child emerges into young adulthood. Meanwhile the group prepared a council space and we awaited their arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so glad that Gerald showed up. I can imagine how intense it would have been for me to have to show up to a group that I was forced to leave, as my 14 or 15 year old self. Let alone how it must have been for Gerald, with his history of social anxiety. We started with naming our intention; to honor Gerald’s time with the group and wish him well on his way. We started with an the prompt, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is a meaningful moment you shared with Gerald during your time in the group? Or what is one hope you have for Gerald’s future?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This was everyone’s chance to say something about Gerald and it was a mix of short sweet well-wishes and deeper reflections on times and laughs shared. After this we returned the talking piece to the council center and offered an open witnessing prompt. We asked for anyone that felt called to take the talking piece from the circle center and share something about Gerald that they had witnessed about him over the two years he had been a part of the group. After a pause, one of the boys started us with a really sweet reflection on how nice and easy going Gerald was to be around. I reflected on a special circumstance that Gerald shared with another boy in the group, how that it was so sweet that they had got to be in the group together and that I hoped that they would get to continue their friendship. The other boy took the talking piece immediately after and also shared how special it had been to share the group with Gerald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerald’s parents also got to share their experiences of the group as parents, and how grateful they were to the boys for sharing their heart-thoughts and feelings about Gerald. At different parts of the process, we tried to allow space for Gerald to speak to the group. He refused, even after one of his parents tried to counsel him about how they had previously practiced what he wanted to say to each of us. It was hard to see Gerald disassociating so hard at this point. It was too much for him to share. I hope that what was shared by his folks and the rest of the group really landed for him, if not on then but at some later point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finished with a little gifting session, where Chaise and I both had gifts to send Gerald on his way. We closed the council and we had a few stilted minutes of getting out of the solemn energy of the council. Individually we said goodbye to Gerald and he and his parents departed. We had thirty minutes and the group really wanted to jump into hot-seat for those of us that were not at the prior hot-seat meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have so much happening in such a short time with the group. Ropes course, summer trip, renegotiation ceremony, more meetings, marking ceremony… I am excited for the deep potential of this time ahead for the group. The question of what do with Gerald has been answered, even if it still gives me a moment’s pause when I think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping Stones folks are oft to note that so much of the swell and sway of our lives are forms of initiation. This was another initiation for me as a group leader and a mentor, around a lesson that was a hard one to learn; how and when do we arrive at the point where we need to remove someone from our field, our group, possibly even our lives, when they are someone that you love and care for deeply.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A generic mental model for geo-data acquisition]]></title><description><![CDATA[I am going to dive into outlining a generic mental model for what organizations tend to do when they have geo-data acquisition needs.

A model like this is useful for creating a common understanding for how organizations tend to deal with the challenges around acquiring geo-data.
&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: very specific reflections on a niche domain I have spent a lot of time operating in. Planning on adding more about metrics at a later date&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;General model for geo-data acquisition&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When seeking to describe a model for anything, a tension exists between simplifying the model down to the most essential aspects, and including nothing more. It is obviously important to detail what is in a model; less obviously, it is also critical to detail what is not included in a model or otherwise delegated to higher or lower scopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my observations of geo-data acquisition practices in the Anglo-American (“Five Eye”) intelligence community, in Terravion, an aerial imagery start up, and working for the Capture Systems team in HERE, the most essential elements for the general model for geo-data acquisition are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acquisition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Requirements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Requirements define what data/outcomes are needed.&lt;/em&gt; The bulk of work around requirements stems from understanding the business problem that needs to be solved, expressing that as a singular requirement or a set of requirements, and framing those requirements in a way that can be easily passed to the acquisition part of the cycle. Typically this process also includes prioritization, basic cost analysis and a way to keep requestors up to date with the ongoing status of their requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Acquisition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two broadest categories of acquisition are 1) &lt;em&gt;getting the data from someone else&lt;/em&gt; 2) &lt;em&gt;collecting it yourself.&lt;/em&gt; While there are operational differences between requesting and receiving data from an external source, versus operating one’s own collection platforms, they share a common lifecycle: requirements need to be translated into acquisition planning, and data needs to be furnished in an agreed-on format and schema. The data provider in either case ought to go through processes including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking whether they already have data to satisfy a requirement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If collection is required, breaking down requirements into a plan of specific tasks for their collection platform to execute on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collection operations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collection validation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data delivery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If data is externally sourced, these processes tend to be shielded from other actors in the rest of the cycle. If internally sourced, the implementation details of collection platform operation can leak out all through the overall cycle, if care is not taken to effectively encapsulate the collection platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feedback is the process of matching the acquired data up to its originating requirements, and confirming whether the acquired data fulfills those requirements.&lt;/em&gt;  Often, the acquired data will undergo further processing and analysis after it has been received. Consequently, feedback may either be incremental or held up until all processing has been completed. The health or efficiency of the overall lifecycle is dependent on whether the feedback flowing back to the rest of the cycle is timely, concise and accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is left out of this model?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps prior to defining requirements are left out. Figuring out what problem sets or market fit are important for an organization; this process is where requirements come from. However delving into that would be a distraction from the core cycle of the model. Similarly, steps after feedback beyond scope; how processing is done, how the data is served or archived, marketing to customers, etc. All important aspects to consider for an organization as a whole but distracting for our current focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers who are familiar with data acquisition might be wondering about some key aspect of the acquisition cycle they are familiar with, and questioning why it is not included. What about ingestion or routing? Or task orchestration? Where is the campaign management? Data integrity/security/privacy? Or quality assurance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tend to be implementation details of the wider cycle. Depending on the scale of data acquisition in an organization, it makes sense to call out more specific steps and sub-processes as they are required. In the same way that routing, fleet management and other collection operations are sub-components of the overall theme of acquisition, quality assurance, ingestion, data integrity measures, etc, are ultimately all forms of feedback. It is not uncommon for different organizations or groups to use different names (campaign management, scope management, collection orchestration) for the same function (a process to ensure requirements are turned into instructions for acquisition platforms). This cross-labelling risk applies even to this model. I have tried to establish the most generic labels for separating the major conceptual parts of the cycle, with requirements, acquisition, and feedback. Perhaps more “intuitive” terms exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;What is the scale of the model?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model is meant to broadly define the major de facto stages of data acquisition, whether undertaken by a small startup, multi-agency governmental community, global multi-national company or even an individual. As an individual, I might be interested in buying a rural property. In order to inform myself about the property’s potential, I might determine I want to assess the soil composition of the area and seasonal sun exposure on the property (hopefully information I can get from the local council/government). Additionally, I might even bring my drone on a visit, and get an overhead view of the spatial relationships across the property. All of this can be expressed in the frame of a generic data acquisition model: figuring out my requirements, acquiring the data from other sources or via my drone, and checking the data (perhaps in real-time on the drone’s live-video feed) against my requirements (the feedback phase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does it make sense to apply a generic data acquisition model to my interest in a property? No. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the model might generally describe what steps I take in getting geo-data related to the property, it probably will not help me catch aspects I may have missed, or otherwise have failed to coordinate. The scale of my project is so small, it easily fits inside my head. Thus, while the model can be applied to smaller scales, it is most useful when applied to larger scales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the scale of a data acquisition effort increases, so increases the value of a shared, clear operating picture, good instrumentation, and data driven decision making. These things are underpinned by a clear mental model for the data acquisition cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an organization grows, its data acquisition cycle graduates from a simple process shared between a few people, to a process that involves more and more components, people and specialized responsibilities. An acquisition cycle that was small, simple and easy to understand when an organization was just getting off the ground, will likely evolve during the growth of the organization in messy and unclear ways. This organizational confusion shows up in a variety of ways, which will be addressed in the next section on common pitfalls in data acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Common challenges in the data acquisition cycle&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a non-exhaustive list of common challenges organizations encounter when scaling their data acquisition efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Requirement-related challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Skipping requirements&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When there is no requirement process or individuals in an organization just skip them, the risk is that resources will be misallocated when acquiring data. This risk only increases as the number of acquisition platforms and data requestors increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete existing data check&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When requirements come in, it is wise to check against existing data holdings. If a requirement is already serviced by existing data, it should be satisfied with that. Not addressing this challenge results in the organization using resources to require unnecessary data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete prioritization system&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If requirements are not prioritized, and/or there is not a clear system by which prioritization occurs, the overall cycle will either misallocate resources to lesser requirements or be delayed as manual efforts are required to seek priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete/confusing requirements interface&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there are multiple ways to submit requirements, unclear processes or poorly defined responsibilities for handling requirements, confusion will rain. The data acquisition cycle will miss requirements, misallocate resources, and fail to consistently serve the goals of the wider organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Challenges in the space between requirements and acquisition&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Requirements that do not translate to clear acquisition tasks&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be coherent ways to translate requirements into tasks for an acquisition platform. The differences in how acquisition platforms operate means that this requires careful thinking and design for any requirement coordinating system. Failure to achieve this means that acquisition platforms will be mis-tasked (thus wasting resources and missing opportunities).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Lack of knowledge about acquisition platform particulars&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every data acquisition system will attempt to abstract the differences between acquisition platforms, and even the differences between individual instances of those platforms. If the requirements system does not allow the articulation of requirements that use the full capabilities of an acquisition platform, the organization will end up missing out on those capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Acquisition-related challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete orchestration&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orchestration is the process whereby collections of requirements are compared to see which ones overlap or are complimentary, allowing for a more efficient set of tasks to be provided to an acquisition platform. Naïve orchestration will create tasks that are nearly identical, duplicating effort and wasting resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Collection anomalies&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every acquisition platform will have anomalies and edge-cases that will make its output less useful. Whether this is atmospheric conditions for clouds, road closures for road-based collectors or software glitches, these errors and blips are a given. Making sure these are tracked and mitigated is a common challenge in data acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Feedback-related challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Skip feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipping a systemic approach to feedback works fine for small scale operations; verbal or ad-hoc feedback about data problems suffices. This does not work as an organization scales. Skipping feedback ultimately just pushes this work on to your customers/end-users, except by that stage there may be no effective way to trace problems back to their origin in the data acquisition cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Slow feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer requirements are left open or acquisition platforms are left without completion feedback, the longer they are left in an unclear state. This can impact orchestration (for example: do you include a requirement in orchestration today, when it was meant to be collected last week but you don’t know if that collection worked?), and otherwise lowers agility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting effective feedback on what acquisition tasks have been completed but not which requirements have been satisfied, or vice-versa, are examples of incomplete feedback. Failing to address this will undermine different decision points throughout the cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Deidentified feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the data identities are not meaningfully tracked through the data acquisition cycle, feedback becomes a challenging forensic process. If someone comes to you and states “these pieces of data are corrupted” and there are not ways to easily identify which task they were acquired by, which requirements they relate to or which acquisition platform they stem from, debugging what is going wrong becomes a time-consuming feat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incremental feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Processing acquired data can require several stages and take time. Some parts of the data might be finished before others. This can make it difficult to define when an acquisition task or a requirement is “done”. If this detail is not ironed out, it can result in confusing statistics on the progress of data acquisition, leading to chaotic decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Wider challenges&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Lack of shared understanding of an organization’s data acquisition cycle&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If individuals working within the data acquisition cycle do not share a common understanding of the cycle, trouble-shooting issues and improving the cycle becomes chaotic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete privacy controls&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquired data can easily include ways to identify individuals and risk breaching their privacy. For both moral and legal reasons, having a system wide awareness of privacy matters is the only way to mitigate the risk of privacy breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Incomplete security controls&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, system wide security awareness ought to be calibrated to the level of risk. Sufficiently large scale technology companies should consider their networks compromised and secure internally on that assumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Misalignment between requirement, acquisition and feedback&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This challenge tends to show up when data acquisition cycles undergo great change in their requirements or access to acquisition platforms. Understanding of new demands or new/lost acquisition platforms has not spread sufficiently across people and systems involved in the whole cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Process duplication&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process duplication is when there are multiple parts an organization repeating the same functionality in the data acquisition cycle, or the organization has completely separate data acquisition cycles co-existing. Acquisition platforms will proliferate, if they have justifiably different capabilities and use-cases. It’s harder to justify having multiple requirement-management or feedback systems; proliferating these tends to cause chaos, as requestors have to petition multiple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Complex coupling&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When different parts of the acquisition cycle are coupling in complex ways, making changes to the different sub-sections or adding new sub-sections to the overall cycle becomes awkward. Changes in one system can cause problems downstream. A common time this becomes apparent is when the acquisition cycle revolves around a particular platform, and then a new platform is introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Unclear reference geometry&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geo-data is unsurprising heavily dependent to having geometric representations. One frustrating challenge that can plague a data acquisition cycle is having reference geometries that do not suit all parts of the cycle, or having unclear ways of translating between the different reference geometry in different parts of the cycle. To provide a task to an acquisition platform, you typically need very well defined geometric instructions: collect all data on these specific roads, or point the sensor at this point on the earth when the platform is at this geometry in space. It is important that these discrete geometries match the intent of geometries defined in requirements, which tend to be coarser. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Priors: Mental Models]]></title><description><![CDATA[I use “Mental models” as a shorthand term for the idea that the way a single human mind comprehends reality, is not reality.

It is the distinction that the way we think about something is not the totality of that thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation&quot;&gt;“The map is not the territory”&lt;/a&gt; is the most common expression of this idea. Why is it important to note this distinction? If we forget the distinction, we end up thinking that our perception of reality &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; actually reality. The negative consequence of letting that replacement happen is we lose touch with reality, and as conditions and circumstances change, we fail to adjust our thinking and actions to our context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why can’t we know the totality of a thing or reality itself?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the totality of a thing, or reality itself requires omniscience: total knowledge and understanding over time. Human cognition currently seems ill-equipped for such a task. &lt;em&gt;;) sly wink&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Limited sensory ability&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start with, our senses provide us with an assortment of limited inputs. Our cognitive processes transform these disparate streams into an astoundingly impressive illusion. Take our vision for example. A simple mental model of our vision imagines it to be like a camera, scanning the outside world and capturing everything it sees, pixel for pixel. The reality is that we can only actively see a tiny part of our field of vision at any time, and our brains are otherwise generating a cohesive view of the world &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception&quot;&gt;(see this entry on Visual Perception for more detail)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are essentially perceiving only a tiny part of everything around us. Meanwhile, our brain is predicting everything else in our sensory field, trying to make a coherent scene out of it all. At this extreme, our brain is creating a mental model of the reality that is all around us. It is built up on thousands of hours of observation and experimentation as infants: dropping our spoons from our high chairs; standing; falling; making noises that echo off walls; grasping any object placed in our tiny hands. We inherit a bunch of our initial stimuli responses from our genetics but largely we learn them as we transition from being a tiny zygote in the womb, into a proto-consciousness and beyond. We tend to take it for granted, that each of us has developed this rich and detailed model of reality. It is truly a marvel if one looks closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Does ‘objective’ reality exist?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Objective’ reality is mediated by our mental model of it. Strictly speaking, that is not very objective at all. Does objective reality exist then? I posit that, functionally, yes it does exist. Without diving off the metaphysical or spiritual deep-ends, we come into this existence as a sensing/thinking/feeling entity, tumbling around in a chaotic mess of sensory inputs, and we consistently unpickle that mess into understandings about the physical world, language, human interactions, abstract concepts and much more. Of course, once we start layering in language, social interactions and abstract concepts, we start proliferating all sorts of mental models to make sense of the inter-subjective part of our existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While language can help us share abstract mental models, like the concept of a divine spirit, a nation-state, or a company, that homo sapien super-power is not sufficient to overcome the perceptual barrier between our cognition and objective reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;What are the practical outcomes of thinking in ‘mental models’?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humility:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging that even strongly held concepts about the world are only partial representations; inaccurate in some way we can’t see.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acknowledging that any model of the world is going to be some sort of simplification of what is going on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discernment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While these factors mean that we accept that all models are wrong, we can also determine that some models are more ‘useful’ than others.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We see two means of understanding the usefulness of a model: Korzybski links usefulness to the model having a ‘similar structure’ to reality, thus allowing us to make predictions and acts upon it. Harari stated a related case for thinking of usefulness as power; how much power could be derived from a model of reality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perspective:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being able to consciously switch into thinking about a situation with a different mental model; that of the person standing in front of you, of a different political belief, of different school of thought. (Of course, we must acknowledge that there are mental models we hold that we cannot shake and that we might not know which or what they are.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting a more holistic view of a situation by looking at it with several mental models.&lt;/li&gt;

Or what you, as a novice of any mastery, could learn from that? If your ‘lack of talent’ is holding you back from taking up singing, carpentry or computer programming? Whether talent even exists?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“…Secrets from the new science of expertise”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: I have spent some time looking at expertise, starting with physical skill acquisition. Read this book thoroughly but have not yet looked into all my research leads around expertise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an interest in getting better at your pursuits, skills and masteries, read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Peak, Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool have set out to both study and concisely present research into the question of how do humans ‘get better at stuff’. Peak seeks to breakdown the research being conducted in the field, add in some little stories to flesh the ideas and concepts out and also wades into some of the implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key concepts the book discusses are &lt;strong&gt;deliberate practice, mental representation, mentorship, and feedback.&lt;/strong&gt; I found the book very engaging, due to my interest in this domain and that it was quite disgestable to me; linking to my strong priors, such as &lt;em&gt;mental models, tight feedback loops, mentorship&lt;/em&gt; from a rites of passage frame and prior reading about &lt;em&gt;practice&lt;/em&gt;. In essence, we build mastery most effectively by undertaking focused, limits-of-ability practice, either under direct coaching (mentorship) or after developing powerful &lt;em&gt;mental representations&lt;/em&gt; that allow for masterful &lt;em&gt;feedback&lt;/em&gt;. There are specific conditions attached to these general terms: you can’t just do one aspect of deliberate practice and expect to progress. So I will unpack some of those aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Deliberate practice&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should I care about deliberate practice? Two major drives for acquiring a skill include wanting to survive and, for the sheer joy of its mastery. If you really want to excel at surviving (hey, some of us are quite keen on living) or simply love getting better at the hobbies and disciplines we practice, deliberate practice is something we should be engaging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I need to work at getting better at stuff, right, of course… &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What one needs to take from the idea of deliberate practice is that just putting in hours of practice is not enough; there are specific conditions that need to happen for it to be fully effective. For illustrative purposes, I’ll list some of the things that lead us to ‘degraded practice’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We go through the motions; we stop paying attention to our practice; we don’t get expert mentorship; we do not analyse our practice to get self-feedback; and … we bail on practice altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we place the two on a spectrum, what does it take to push us from the ‘degraded practice’ end of a spectrum, to the deliberate practice end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having a clearly defined and well established path to mastery, with easily identifiable experts; I am labelling these &lt;a href=&quot;#cef&quot;&gt;“Clear expertise fields”&lt;/a&gt;, something not common to all fields&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#mentor&quot;&gt;Mentorship&lt;/a&gt; from teachers/masters of the discipline; adjusting if a teacher can no longer push you beyond your limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meaningful, regular &lt;a href=&quot;#feed&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#menrep&quot;&gt;Mental representations&lt;/a&gt;, that allow one to self-correct errors during practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continued &lt;a href=&quot;#foc&quot;&gt;focus&lt;/a&gt; during practice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#ooc&quot;&gt;Practice that is ‘difficult’&lt;/a&gt;; it continues to push your boundaries, even if this is exhausting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;“Clear expertise” fields &lt;a name=&quot;cef&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These fields tend to have two main qualities. 1) The field is already well-developed, so expectations about mastery and paths to achieving that are already well-defined. and 2) the field has direct competition and rankings that make it ‘easy’ to compare practitioners. Examples of this span chess, classical music, all sorts of sports but particularly individual sports, martial arts, and structured forms of dance. As the authors say on p.98, “What doesn’t qualify?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty much anything in which there is no or little direct competition, such as gardening … [being a] business manager, teacher, electrician, engineer, consultant, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is somewhat unfortunate if you care muchly about one of those “excluded” fields, something I will explore later with software engineering. I would also argue to include aviation, medicine, civil engineering and similar as ‘clear expertise’ fields; fields that do not have competition perse but that have well defined metrics (often with life or death consequences!) by which to gauge interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Mentorship &lt;a name=&quot;mentor&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mentors guide you on your path to mastery. They often set one’s curriculum, shift the focus of practice and, most importantly, they provide rapid, accurate feedback on errors. Getting accurate and speedy feedback is one of the most powerful mechanisms in human experience. It is the essential underpinning of how we learn to navigate reality overtime. Mentors greatly improve this feedback process, particularly if the discipline is well understood. Beyond their instructive guidance, a broader sense of being mentored by someone no doubt has benefits to motivation and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Feedback &lt;a name=&quot;feed&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are constantly predicting what will happen around us and correcting our expectations based on sensory input. The feedback we glean from practice and from our mentors is just a more built-up version of this. While mentor feedback is very valuable, to pursue excellence, one must figure out how to give oneself worthwhile feedback. This leads us to …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Mental representations &lt;a name=&quot;menrep&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson and Pool place great importance on their concept of &lt;em&gt;mental representations&lt;/em&gt;. They are important because they must be developed by practitioners for them to be able to critique themselves. Think of how a musician can glance at a score and immediate develop a ‘sense’ of how it should sound. A dancer feeling the stickiness of their last sequence and knowing that they did not quite nail it. A chess master or a professional soccer player can look at a snapshot of their respective fields of play and predict what will happen next. Mental representations also define how we structure our skills and their interrelated parts in our minds. Like how a guitarist will structure collections of notes into chords and progressions. I would add that “clear expertise” fields probably have defined mental representations formally, and have them shared across the whole discipline. Where as in other less mature/structured fields, there are a multitude of bespoke mental representations going around and it becomes unclear how easily concepts can be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Focus &lt;a name=&quot;foc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to stick with your practice, and deeply drop into the &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; of it. Beyond emphasizing its importance, Peak doesn’t go deep into how to cultivate focus. That is left to the reader. Much has been said in contemporary media about the economy of attention/distraction urbanites exist in. I won’t delve into that issue here but to ask: If it is true that we are being distracted more so than ever before, are we at risk of diminishing society’s (and our own) ability to acquire mastery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Out-of-comfort &lt;a name=&quot;ooc&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberate practice requires constant tuning and shifting; we get less and less value out of revising the same material/pattern over and over again (spaced repetition learning details how to maximise that). Peak is very clear about one aspect related to this: Deliberate practice is uncomfortable. It is frustrating. We learn some aspect of a discipline. It is difficult at first. We get the hang of it. Perhaps even a little feeling of accomplishment comes our way. But then we need to do something different, harder. We probably mess up and get frustrated again. Just to keep making progress. This process can be literally fatiguing. Peak noted this fatigue in the high performing classical music students; putting in huge reps of deliberate practice and integrating afternoon naps to compensate. Obviously there is a very real skill in itself of balancing how exhausting, challenging and difficult practice is, with also making sure we are staying focused, healthy and ‘well-rounded’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Implications for education &lt;a name=&quot;educ&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education, notionally oriented to improving expertise, is the first field that the authors examine regarding the implications of Peak. Specifically, in chapter 9, they detail a trial conducted at the University of British Columbia, at the undergraduate level. Splitting a large physics course into two cohort, the study only shifted their twelfth week of instruction, on the topic of electromagnetic waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study cohort, the goal was not to just feed the students the required information for that week but to instead prompt them to practice thinking like physicists. Before each class both cohorts were prompted to read short additional material. The first difference was that the study cohort was also asked a battery of true/false online questions, that would give them immediate feedback about whether they were employing the same mental representations that a physicist ought to be. The next difference was the study cohort dropped the classic lecture style. Instead, the cohort was broken up into small groups and asked ‘clicker’ questions. These questions could be answered electronically, the answers sent straight to the instructor. Before answering, the students would be given a chance to discuss the question within their group. After the answers were submitted, the instructor would display the answers and discuss, and then answer additional questions students had. Several of these questions were asked and if a decent number of students struggled with a particular concept, the lecturer would take that as a cue to offer a mini-lecture on that topic. This question-discuss-answer-feedback loop was replicated by another ‘active learning’ task, where students wrote up short answers and the lecturers moved around the groups, dropping into different discussions. This allowed a tighter feedback loop than the traditional lecture: students were regularly tested on their concepts (without the pressure of being ‘graded’), got feedback, with some level of expert mentorship and ostensibly built up better mental representations of electromagnetic waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what was the tested difference between the study and control cohorts after this? Both cohorts received multiple-choice quiz. The control cohort averaged 41% and the study cohort averaged 74% (Random guessing would net you about 23%). That is a huge improvement. The study authors determined that it produced outcomes better than two standard deviations above the mean, overcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_sigma_problem&quot;&gt;Bloom’s 2 sigma problem&lt;/a&gt;. Certainly a result that I would like to see replicated in a wide cross-section of studies. This study was published in 2011, and I would be curious to know to what extent these techniques have been adopted across higher education. On p.254, the authors do touch on this subject, saying that the techniques rapidly spread across science departments at UBC… but we hear nothing about their wider dissemination from the 5-6 years between the referenced study and Peak’s publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other main line of study I would like to see more of is: would these educational models also hold for younger learners. The ‘test-and-adjust’ frame of Wieman and co’s work reminds me of another simple educational intervention, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.povertyactionlab.org/case-study/teaching-right-level-improve-learning&quot;&gt;“Teaching At The Right Level”&lt;/a&gt;; testing kids on specific abilities and moving them into different grade classes based on their results. The JPAL studies I just linked to are not the first time I have heard of the effectiveness of avoiding age-class bracketing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2CjPXPE&quot;&gt;The Finnish Lesson&lt;/a&gt; cites the idea of ‘teaching to the right level’ as one of the important aspects of why the Finns performed so well by international educational measures. Wieman and co’s study included a micro-level loop of ‘testing to the right level’, by testing students and slowing down when material was not understood. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Implications for software engineering &lt;a name=&quot;engderp&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software engineering is not a &lt;a href=&quot;#cef&quot;&gt;“clear expertise”&lt;/a&gt; field. It is an immature discipline, relative to other technical industries like aviation, construction, and medicine. There is not a clear path to overall mastery; more so there are many paths to incomplete masteries in different sub-domains and environments. At its worst (hacker news, twitter, blog comments), this is evident in vitriolic arguments, vigilante &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Gatekeeping&quot;&gt;gatekeeping&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bikeshedding&quot;&gt;‘bikeshedding’&lt;/a&gt; discussions. This is because it is a relatively new discipline, is rapidly growing and changing, and tends to forget about its history. The industry’s rapid growth means it is both difficult to determine what to be mentored on, and where to even find mentors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paints a rather glum outlook for the aspiring engineer or developer, wanting to pursue deliberate practice in their field. However, despite these legitimate frustrations, the industry does have several bright spots. Partial tight feedback loops are very achievable in software development. Just getting a program to run and getting some output can provide immediate and clear feedback about your efforts. I say it is partial however, since there are many pitfalls and bad habits one might not be alerted with this simple level of feedback loop. Another advantage (relative to the industries mentioned at the beginning of this section), is the bewildering array of open source and free tooling, tutorials, forums, chat channels and help available online. In part these are a direct response to the disorganized nature of computer engineering mastery; and it is certainly challenging to determine the value of feedback and advice garnered from across this mass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically for my own circumstances, it reinforces the need to practice coding regularly (partially fulfilled by this blog), continue to seek mentorship (especially since it is lacking at work) where and when I can (Hello &lt;a href=&quot;https://bradfieldcs.com/&quot;&gt;Bradfield!&lt;/a&gt;) and try to understand what mental representations I am operating with when coding.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Touching on talent, drive, motivation, opportunity, IQ and privilege&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all this discussion on deliberate practice and its importance to building expertise, I have not yet talked about the place of ‘innate talent’ (Addressed in chapter 8 of Peak). As a society, we place a great deal of focus on natural ability (or lack thereof); we tend to operate under a mental model whereby some folks just have incredible talent and many do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have it. We pigeon-hole ourselves; “I don’t have a brain for math”, “I just can’t hold a tune”, “I’m not a computer person”, “I’m just not good with people”, etc. However, one of the consistent themes of Peak is that ‘innate talent’ and ‘natural ability’ play a negligible or very limited role in expertise (to be clear, this is not to suggest that ‘talented’ people don’t exist, in the sense that ‘talented’ people are good in their domain because of their history of practice and not as some genetic blessing). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors reference the importance of deliberate practice over innate talent through examples including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1szl%C3%B3_Polg%C3%A1r&quot;&gt;The Polgar Family&lt;/a&gt; creating-chess-genius experiment (generating three female chess geniuses in an era when women’s minds weren’t considered suitable for chess);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experiments into whether folks can develop perfect pitch, widely considered as something you either had or didn’t have (In the study, some folk were successful in developing perfect pitch but not all participants);&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A British study done on chess-playing children of a range of ability and IQs. It found two interesting results: for the whole cohort, practice was the biggest determiner of ability, with IQ having some impact. But for the elite playing part of the cohort, IQ played no role in ability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Peak authors consciously avoid detailing the depths of the debate about what IQ actually measures on page 227, while highlighting how IQ intersects with expertise. Seeing as IQ did have a positive correlation for the non-elite chess-kids, they posit that a higher IQ might aid someone slightly in picking up a mental representation or strategy. However, at the elite level, this slight advantage seemed to fade away; deliberate practice reigned supreme when it came to ability. Consequently, from this perspective, we should view the place of education not as some sort of unearthing of innate talent or high IQ individuals, and more as a scaffold for building up mastery across all students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If IQ is not a decisive accompaniment to deliberate practice, what then is? Peak does not go into this at length but the authors do make references to a range of internal and external factors that matter for building expertise. On the internal side, practitioners need to cultivate motivation to do practice, grit at sticking with mastery challenges, and a willingness to pursue a specific mastery. These may well be meta-skills that can also be cultivated, or innate; this is not really addressed in Peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External factors include access to mentorship, privilege and supportive community. If you cannot convince someone to mentor you, progress in your mastery will be tougher. When I say privilege in this context, I am essentially asking: how free is an individual to pursue their mastery? Do they live a monastic lifestyle, free from distractions, provided all required tools and materials to practice, fed and sheltered? Or do they have to work, be a care-giver to others, scrape together funds to buy supplies and tools? As for the presence or absence of a supportive community; these can provide external motivation (practicing with peers, encouragement from family), mentorship opportunities and resources. The book title includes a glowing quote from the Economist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;”[Peak] offers an optimistic anti-determinism that ought to influence how people educate children, manage employees, and spend their time. The good news is that to excel one need only look within.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is that last sentence that I think is a misrepresentation of the sum of Peak’s findings. If we miss the importance of the factors that support and sustain deliberate practice, we risk being blind to systemic biases against some groups and their pursuit of mastery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Implications for me!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peak feels like the coalescing of learning moments from my past. It has been a fantastic reminder that I need to put more care and time into my masteries. While I disparaged the Economist quote, I do strongly agree with its view that Peak offers an optimistic anti-determinism for humanity. Collectively, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; worth investing in building skills and education, if we heed the lessons on the research into expertise. We are not wholly the result of some genetic and circumstantial lottery. I do feel the pull between several disciplines, and I must acknowledge that splitting my time does ‘slow me down’ in any one mastery. But that feels like balance for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A confluence of factors have driven me to set up this site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wanting to clarify my thinking by writing; framing my thoughts in prose and paragraph,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wanting to have a place to publish these writings,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the desire to move more of my online life off social media and on to my own ‘platform’, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;using all that as an opportunity to dabble in a few technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why: which topics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider having a board range of interesting and pursuits to be a strong foundation for living a ‘good life’. I will be covering a range of topics, touching on the mind, embodied living and the soul. Each of the different topics and their importance may warrant a deeper look at another time but I want to touch on them briefly here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Dance is the easiest&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In large part because its expression is non-verbal. When I post up some of my movement practice, I might make a comment about the context or the music. But so much of movement and dance for me is the escape from words and that way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Engineering and systems thinking&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documenting what I am learning and thinking about from a systems-design or engineering perspective. The journey into this technical domain began with my career as a geospatial analyst; a cartographer of sorts. I still get to wrestle with the challenges of the geospatial domain in my current role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Rites of Passage&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fortunate to be able to volunteer my time to lead a youth group. The organization that backs the youth group, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steppingstonesproject.org/&quot;&gt;The Stepping Stones Project&lt;/a&gt; is focused on rites of passage and developing our relationships to community and nature. Their model begins with this premise; many industrialized societies have forgotten or lost the ceremony and structure around teenage rites of passage. There are deep and rich traditions of marking the transitions of our life in some areas (such as funerals and weddings). However, the marking of a transition from childhood to adolescence is sorely missing in the lives of many youth coming of age today. Stepping Stones seeks to change that. This leads to my next topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Masculinity for 21st century&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my eyes, masculinity (male gender roles) needs to be updated. And certainly not in the revisionist, retrograde fashion that some folk suggest. As intersectional feminism continues its push for multi-generational change in the roles and possibilities for women and equality for all, some men have been triggered by the uncertainty of change and the resetting of power dynamics. Operating under a scarcity mindset, from a place of fear and of understanding the world in zero-sum game terms (more for someone else, automatically means less for me), these men (and some women) yearn to return to ‘simpler’ times when gender roles were more or less fixed. I seek to articulate and build new masculinities (plural!), that adapt and integrate intersectional liberation of all people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;How humans get things done&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably my broadest topics, used as a catch all for my general fascination with how people come together, and how they get things done together. Covering both the communal, being together aspect and the productive, coordinating, collaborating aspects of groups of humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll start from here. Perhaps time will reveal some other themes that I continue to return to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;👋 Welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chelsey and I visited a friend’s pre-burn party. They had built their core camp infrastructure out of shipping containers and other kit, assembled it in a warehouse and threw a party to test it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn’t spend long there but before it got crowded, we got to dance. Kris Roller was filming some promo style footage for the camp. Riley (Chelsey’s work buddy and bestie) came over and pulled us over to the space featured in this clip, asking us to dance for the camera. The lighting, energy of the space and Kris’ great eye and steady cam produced this little gem of us moving.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Returning from the Bodega Bay Summer Trip]]></title><description><![CDATA[Epistemic status: Reflective, anecdotal I just spent my birthday hiking up a windswept hill with my youth group, of teenage boys, and my…]]></description><link>https://twicefire.com/ritesofpassage/bodega/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://twicefire.com/ritesofpassage/bodega/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Oct 2018 15:11:55 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epistemic status: Reflective, anecdotal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just spent my birthday hiking up a windswept hill with my youth group, of teenage boys, and my homie Chaise, instead of spending my birthday and anniversary weekend with my love Chelsey and my friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future shape of humanity hangs in the balance. Who and what are we to become in this century? One facet of that is the future of “men”; men-folk, boys, lads, however we choose to identity them (/us).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started my journey with this group over two years ago; it was already apparent then, that the fate of men was &lt;strong&gt;‘up for grabs’&lt;/strong&gt;; contested. In part, this comes from our industrial way of living, disrupting the guidance, mentoring and rites of passage that youth commonly received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with this disruption, boys and young men can’t wait; they try to figure things out for themselves. From movies, from porn, from computer games, from memes, from internet chat boards, but mainly from their equally anchorless peers. It is a real roll of the dice in that regard. And some of them find and follow 4chan, “Men’s Rights Activists”, nihilist edge-lords, Pick Up Artists, Jordan B Peterson and other folks whose values and ideas take us backward, towards even more oppressive and stratified ways of being together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But where are ‘we’? Are ‘we’ showing up for these boys? ‘We’, cis men-folk that strive to be ‘woke’. That strive to be ‘progressive’, ‘forward-thinking’, ‘conscious’, etc. Are we too caught up in our own lives; our own troubles; our own pleasures and responsibilities; to show up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, our program has a surplus of women group-leaders, more than we have girl youth; and a lack of men group-leaders for the boys that are seeking mentorship. Big Brother/Big Sister programs have dire need of Big Brothers and a oversupply of Big Sisters. Men seem to be increasingly abandoning the teaching profession. At our parent meetings, we have one father show up out of five (we have two lesbian couple families, so not counting those families for this purpose). Yesterday when the boys were picked up from the camping trip, one of the boys noted, &lt;em&gt;“None of the dads are here to pick us up”&lt;/em&gt; (although two of them dropped their boys off on Saturday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like women are showing up for youth of all genders but are ‘we’? Did we miss this mentorship, guidance and care from men-folk in our development? Are we left questioning what it even looks like, let alone how ‘we’ could provide it to the next generation of young men?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of us are following and figuring out our own paths. I don’t expect all of us men-folk to contribute in the same way. But I am asking us to do more. At a minimum, work on yourself. Figure out if you missed out on a rite of passage, some mentorship or guidance, and then go and seek it out. Figure out the best traits that humans exhibit, whether they are defined as masculine or feminine, and explore your best-self through them. Don’t forget that some of the best ways to work on yourself are to help, mentor and learn with others. You can grow and heal around being ‘a man’ while working with youth and sharing in their search for what it is to be ‘a better man’. Run a youth group; coach a sports team; show up for your nephews, younger brothers, etc; try out Big Brother; be a camp counselor; Teach for America; work for nature programs… find a way, please, please, find a way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steppingstonesproject.org/&quot;&gt;Stepping Stones Project&lt;/a&gt; if you can; donate your money, your time or fill one of the open roles!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Smoke and Mirrors]]></title><description><![CDATA[It only took me just over an hour to hike out to this point.
