## How do we proactively make use of adjacency in our sense-making and decision-making?

###### Adjacency and personal sense-making
Like Danny's reflections on their choice of dance community in Berlin, being attuned to what are the adjacent qualities of a community can help us navigate those spaces with greater judgement and wisdom. If I am really into break dance but notice that community does not include adjacent qualities that engage me, I can just enjoy it for the pursuit of that mastery without needing it to be a promising ground for deep belonging. If I am a black American, perhaps I will desire a community or space to reach a certain level of anti-racist-adjacency before I commit to it. 

Another way we can reflect on our personal circumstances through the lens of adjacency is checking in about some of the things we 'just go along with'. Do I really like sinking beers and watching the football or am I just doing it to fit in with this crowd? Am I really excited to chant religious hymns from a tradition I don't follow, when I just want to do some yoga? Am I just going to Sunday service because that is what everyone here does? How much are we just band-wagoning pursuits in our lives, when we could be better served by uncovering what really interests us? This is the curse of availability; we can limit ourselves by filling our life up with what is within our easy grasp.
