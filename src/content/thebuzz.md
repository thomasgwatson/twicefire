About seven months ago, I was out on a dry lake bed with a few chums. We had a little project, an extra reason to get us up before sun-rise. This is one of the little pieces that fell out of that little mission. My first time dancing to this track. Pretty pleased with it, despite the weird cam glitching in parts of it.
