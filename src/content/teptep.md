Arriving a few days early in New Mexico, I hired a car and drove out into the valleys, forests and mesas north of Santa Fe. This is a form of preparation for me, for my time at SFI. A time of deep enquiry into the state of the planet, and what my place in everything is.

Movement and dance is a part of that process for me. This is what fell out of that.
