ðŸ‘‹ Welcome.

Chelsey and I visited a friend's pre-burn party. They had built their core camp infrastructure out of shipping containers and other kit, assembled it in a warehouse and threw a party to test it out. 

We didn't spend long there but before it got crowded, we got to dance. Kris Roller was filming some promo style footage for the camp. Riley (Chelsey's work buddy and bestie) came over and pulled us over to the space featured in this clip, asking us to dance for the camera. The lighting, energy of the space and Kris' great eye and steady cam produced this little gem of us moving.
