FROM INITIATION PIECE

What does it mean to be an 'adult'?
- The concepts of man-child and woman-child have been floating around culturally for a few years
- Legal definition is simple, necessary and doesn't get at


#### Listless 'adults'

- "Kids these days" mentality
- Boomer, Millennial inter-generational warfare (Boomers have been replaced by Millenials as the largest demo segment, X-ers never took that place)
- The vicissitudes of life: what context are we surrounded by, other traumas
- The uninitiated raising the uninitiated: a version of intergenerational trauma

In my mind, this is just another iteration of the "Kids these days" dynamic, and almost ritualistic flogging of contemporary youth in print or media, seemingly stretching back centuries.


This desire to self-initiate can lead youth to seek out mentorship and guidance from adults outside their family but often this desire leads to peer-group and solo initiations of sorts. I view peer or solo initiations as neutral containers for initiation on average but with high variance. One positive example; Peers can be more accepting of a youth's developing divergent identity than family. One negative example; Peer pressure can lead us to do some stupid stuff: pranks, binge drinking, dangerous driving, 
 
 Unstructured self-initiation can sometimes look like a grab-bag of different trappings of adult life, most of the time emphasizing the 'freedoms' of that but sometimes dwelling on the responsibilities.


I am confident most folk will know 'adults' they consider childish or child-like in some fashion. There are Hollywood movies practically celebrating the concept of being a man-child (little 'celebration' of being a woman-child however...), and articles berating peter-pan syndrome in the dating world. I am also fairly certain that most folk would have different conceptions or ideas about these perceived child-like qualities, and what the threshold point is between someone dropping into immature behavior and someone trapped in a child-like state. Take 'play' or 'playfulness' as a quality. Some see the concept of play completely in the realm of children, and a wasteful pursuit. They would likely see a range of 'peter-pans' out there. Increasing others, myself included, argue that 'play' is an important learning and creative outlet, for all ages.
