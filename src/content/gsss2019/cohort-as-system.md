<sub>This is the first post in a short series of reflections about my time at the Santa Fe Institute's Global Sustainability Summer School</sub>

The [Santa Fe Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute) has a deep focus on complex adaptive systems, such as organisms, ecosystems, cities and similar. In the lead up to my time at SFI for the [GSSS](https://twicefire.com/summerschool/), I have been pondering what I want to get out of the experience and how best to achieve that. One frame falling out of that process is "If our GSSS cohort of faculty and students is itself a complex social system, what system features and leverage points can we identify and experiment with?". This short post is mainly for the purpose of kicking off this question within the cohort.

#### Cohort characteristics

Here is a short list of what I want out of the cohort:
- Trust
- Belonging
- Curiosity
- Continuity 
- Virtuous cycles; learning, collaboration, continuity

---

#### Leverage points

Some leverage points off the top of my head:
- persistent communications; slack, email list
- communal dynamics; icebreakers, council, 'trust building exercises'
- prescribed values; community agreements, community aspirations
- celebrate "I don't know!"
