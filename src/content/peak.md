##

How you ever wondered what sets the best chess players a part from the rest? Or what you, as a novice of any mastery, could learn from that? If your 'lack of talent' is holding you back from taking up singing, carpentry or computer programming? Whether talent even exists?
## "...Secrets from the new science of expertise"

<sub>_Epistemic status: I have spent some time looking at expertise, starting with physical skill acquisition. Read this book thoroughly but have not yet looked into all my research leads around expertise_<sub/>

If you have an interest in getting better at your pursuits, skills and masteries, read on!

Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool have set out to both study and concisely present research into the question of how do humans get better at stuff. Peak seeks to breakdown the research being conducted in the field, add in some little stories to flesh the ideas and concepts out and also wades into some of the implications.

The key concepts the book discusses are **deliberate practice, mental representation, mentorship, and feedback.** I found the book very engaging, due to my interest in this domain and that it was quite disgestable to me; linking to my strong priors, such as _mental models, tight feedback loops, mentorship_ from a rites of passage frame and prior reading about _practice_. In essence, we build mastery most effectively by undertaking focused, limits-of-ability practice, either under direct coaching (mentorship) or after developing powerful _mental representatons_ that allow for masterful _feedback_. There are specific conditions attached to these general terms: you can't just do one aspect of deliberate practice and expect to progress. So I will unpack some of those aspects

#### Deliberate practice

Why should I care about deliberate practice? Two major drives for acquiring a skill include wanting to survive and, for the sheer joy of its mastery. If you really want to excel at surviving (hey, some of us are quite keen on living) or simply love getting better at the hobbies and disciplines we practice, deliberate practice is something we should be engaging in.

> So I need to work at getting better at stuff, right, of course... 

What one needs to take from the idea of deliberate practice is that not only do you need to put in hours of practice to improve in your mastery but there are also specific conditions around that practice that need to happen for it to be fully effective. For illustrative purposes, I'll label what most of us are doing as 'regular practice', when we try to get better at something. We go through the motions, we stop paying attention to our practice, we don't get expert mentorship, we do not analyse our practice to get self-feedback and ... we bail on practice altogether.

If we place the two on a spectrum, what does it take to push us from the 'regular practice' end of a spectrum, to the deliberate practice end?

 - Having a clearly defined and well established path to mastery, with easily identifiable experts; I am labelling these ["Clear expertise fields"](#cef), something not common to all fields
 - [Mentorship](#mentor) from teachers/masters of the discipline; adjusting if a teacher can no longer push you beyond your limit
 - Meaningful, regular [feedback](#feed)
 - [Mental representations](#menrep), that allow one to self-correct errors during practice
 - Continued [focus](#foc) during practice
 - [Practice that is 'difficult'](#ooc); it continues to push your boundaries, even if this is exhausting

###### "Clear expertise" fields <a name="cef"></a>

These fields tend to have two main qualities. 1) The field is already well-developed, so expectations about mastery and paths to achieving that are already well-defined. and 2) the field has direct competition and rankings that make it 'easy' to compare practitioners. Examples of this span chess, classical music, all sorts of sports but particularly individual sports, martial arts, and structured forms of dance. As the authors say on p.98, "What doesn't qualify?"

>Pretty much anything in which there is no or little direct competition, such as gardening ... [being a] business manager, teacher, electrician, engineer, consultant, and so on.

That is somewhat unfortunate if you care muchly about one of those "excluded" fields, something I will explore later with software engineering.

###### Mentorship <a name="mentor"></a>

Mentors guide you on your path to mastery. They often set one's curriculum, shift the focus of practice and, most importantly, they provide rapid, accurate feedback on errors. Getting accurate and speedy feedback is one of the most powerful mechanisms in human experience. It is the essential underpinning of how we learn to navigate reality overtime. Mentors greatly improve this feedback process, particularly if the discipline is well understood. Beyond their instructive guidance, a boarder sense of being mentored by someone no doubt has benefits to motivation and well-being.

###### Feedback <a name="feed"></a>

We are constantly predicting what will happen around us and correcting our expectations based on sensory input. The feedback we glean from practice and from our mentors is just a more built-up version of this. While mentor feedback is very valuable, to pursue excellence, one must figure out how to give oneself worthwhile feedback. This leads us to ...

###### Mental representations <a name="menrep"></a>

Ericcson and Pool place great importance on their concept of _mental representations_. They are critical because they must be developed by practitioners for them to be able to critique themselves. Think of how a musician can glance at a score and immediate develop a 'sense' of how it should sound. A dancer feeling the stickiness of their last sequence and knowing that they did not quite nail it. A chess master or a professional soccer player can look at a snapshot of their respective fields of play and predict what will happen next. Mental representations also define how we structure our skills and their interrelated parts in our minds. Like how a guitarist will structure collections of notes into chords and progressions. I would add that "clear expertise" fields probably have defined mental representations formally, and have them shared across the whole discipline. Where as in other less mature/structured fields, there are a multitude of bespoke mental representations going around and it becomes unclear how easily concepts can be shared.

---
###### Focus <a name="foc"></a>

Being able to stick with your practice, and deeply drop into the _now_ of it. Beyond emphasizing its importance, Peak doesn't go deep into how to cultivate focus. That is left to the reader. Much has been said in contemporary media about the economy of attention/distraction urbanites exist in. I won't delve into that issue here but to ask: If it is true that we are being distracted more so than ever before, are we at risk of diminishing society's (and our own) ability to acquire mastery?

---
###### Out-of-comfort <a name="ooc"></a>

Deliberate practice requires constant tuning and shifting; we get less and less value out of revising the same material/patttern over and over again (spaced repetition learning details how to maximise that). Peak is very clear about one aspect related to this: Deliberate practice is uncomfortable. It is frustrating. We learn some aspect of a discipline. Its difficult at first. We get the hang of it. Perhaps even a little feeling of accomplishment comes our way. But then we need to do something different, harder and probably mess up and get frustrated again. Just to keep making progress. This process can be literally fatiguing. Looking at classical musicians, putting in huge reps of deliberate practice, they often integrated afternoon naps into their routines to keep fresh during later practice hours. Obvious there is a very real skill in itself of balancing how exhausting, challenging and difficult practice is, with also making sure we are staying focused, healthy and 'well-rounded'.

> Hopefully you now have a reasonable grounding in the key concepts of Peak. Next I will focus on my thoughts about implications inspired by reading Peak or referenced in the book itself.

### Implications for education <a name="educ"></a>

Education, notionally orientated to improving expertise, is the first field that the authors examine regarding the implications of Peak. Specifically, they detail a trial conducted at the university undergraduate level
