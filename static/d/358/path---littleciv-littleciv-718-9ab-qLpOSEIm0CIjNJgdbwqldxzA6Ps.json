And it will end either by a radical transformation of society and the global economy or ‘the end’ will be forced upon us by systemic failures of economies and societies across the globe (bought on by ecosystem collapse, more frequent ‘natural’ disasters/harvest failures, and increasing competition for resources/water/land). Forecasts need specific conditions, distinct time limits and defined probabilities in order for them to be fairly evaluated/judged in the future. Defining what conditions meet the the-world-as-we-know-it-will-end criteria is not very specific with my description so far but I can offer some initial time limits and defined possibilities to begin with, and see if I update over the course of detailing my thoughts.</p>\n<p>To begin, the chance of the-world-as-we-know-it-will-end if we stick to current policies is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>90% by or before 2100</li>\n<li>70% by or before 2090</li>\n<li>53% by or before 2080</li>\n<li>35% by or before 2070</li>\n<li>28% by or before 2060</li>\n<li>22% by or before 2050</li>\n<li>17% by or before 2040</li>\n<li>12% by or before 2030</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are somewhat nebulous forecasts by their nature, due to the scale of factors and complexity of their inter-relation; they are certainly not built up from the ground level on quantified data. Primarily they integrate the ‘transformation by choice’ and the less desirable ‘transformation by collapse’ outcomes. I am rating the likelihood of radical transformation as low throughout the whole century, decreasing as we approach the end of the century. Largely because it is systematically challenging to achieve, and then later in the century it will be too late to avoid ‘transformation by collapse’ (although still worth it to soften the blow). Getting every major polluting nation to radically shift their behavior, requires practically each of them to come to that place via their internal politics (since international coordination continues to be sorely hampered). It’s a lot of separate battles that need to be won, and we are still in a serious hole if even a handful continue to pollute. This <em>could</em> be mitigated if other polluters got beyond zero net emissions to significant net negative emissions. ‘Transformation by collapse’ encapsulates a network of interconnected outcomes; famine from multiple ‘breadbasket’ failures, conflicts over resources, ecosystem failure, large scale geopolitical conflicts going ‘hot’, higher frequency of ‘natural’ disasters, migration/displacement pressures triggered by all of the above. The criteria for ‘transformation by collapse’ is the partial or full failure of the international political and economic order; a sustained break-down in globalized trade (including prolonged global depression), globalized political stability or a large proportion (40%) of the world in sustained conflict and/or economic depression.</p>\n<p>On a side note, ‘transformation by technical salvation’ is also factored in, integrated into the ‘transformation by choice’ outcomes. Geo-engineering schemes tend to require serious coordination and resources, with a mix of projected pay-offs (but I still won’t discount the possibility of a well-resources rogue actor from trying; eg China dumping tons of iron oxide into the distant seas). Similarly, ‘no transformation but no problems’ outcomes (if we really whiffed on the science or modelling) are accounted as a very low chance (x &#x3C; 1%). We have a <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-do-climate-models-work\">fairly sizeable handle on the major mechanisms</a> at play here and it is unlikely there is some unknown planetary buffer that will magically stop greenhouse effects from warming and destabilizing the climate.</p>\n<p>Ideally, I would break this overall forecast down into a series of more defined and discrete forecasts (<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/evidence-on-good-forecasting-practices-from-the-good-judgment-project-an-accompanying-blog-post/\">one of the many tips coming out of forecasting science</a>). These would be used to refine the overall forecast and to update it over time. I may yet find time to delve deeper into a full forecasting project. I have recently read up on various topics around climate modeling, the carbon cycle, the glaciation cycle, negative emission technologies, questions around methane’s role, and more. Each of these could be worthwhile sources of forecasting questions. As a lazy proxy, I can use the periodic IPCC models to gauge how countries are performing now and what projected average global temperature will result. The next IPCC report is due out 2021 but some <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-why-results-from-the-next-generation-of-climate-models-matter\">preliminary modelling is available</a>. It does not look good for those wanting to avoid collapse :(</p>\n<p>One compact data point that illustrates our situation starts with the analysis that we were due to enter a glaciation period in the last few hundred years. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/529162a\">Ganopolski et al</a> model that without human agricultural practices, CO<sub>2</sub> would have only been 240 parts per million around 1800, before the onset of industrialization. CO<sub>2</sub> at 240 ppm would have seen the return of a glaciation period, given the changes to earth’s orbit. However, human activity pre-industrialization had already boosted CO<sub>2</sub> to 280 ppm, enough to delay the onset of the next glaciation period by at least 50,000 years. Glaciation would slowly (over 10,000 to 20,000 years) lead to an ice age, with average surface temperature reductions of 8°C. Today, CO<sub>2</sub> is over 415 ppm and increasing, the highest concentration it has been in 8 million years. An extra 40 ppm, if stretched over ten to twenty thousand years, would have allowed us to skip an ice age. We are now 135 ppm over that ‘avoid the next ice age’ level and this amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air will slingshot us into significant warming in the near-term (this century), even if we stopped all emissions today.</p>\n<h2>Orientation</h2>\n<p>So, what courses of action are left for individuals, communities and larger political entities that are open to understanding our predicament? Since sitting with my partner, developing our own plans, I have continued to return to a few encompassing mindsets that help me categorize how folks are orienting themselves to life as we know it. The main two of these mindsets are “Big Civilization” and “Little Civilization”. In essence, “Big Civ” represents the continuation (via maintenance, transformation and salvation) of our globalized, urbanized, industrialized way of life. And “Little Civ” represents whatever can be held on to in a world that is increasingly destructured; deglobalized, deurbanized, deindustrialized, and in worse case scenarios, depopulated. A world that requires much more self-sufficiency. “Big Civ” and “Little Civ” are orientations that can be applied to other civilizational crisis: the threat of nuclear war or WWIII; global pandemics; general threats of economic instability arising from inequality; an asteroid forecast to hit earth in 50 years time; you name it. For this post and most of my thinking around these orientations, I am focusing on climate chaos as the crisis at hand.</p>\n<h4>Big Civilization</h4>\n<p>“Big Civ” is built on the assumption or hope and optimism that 1) Things are fine the way they are 2) things are not great but we can turn it around, and 3) things are bad but if we really dig in, we can still turn things around. “Turning it around” in a climate context boils down to a range of interventions that involve carbon emission reductions, coordinated political action and/or savvy innovation. Many of the IPCC’s <a href=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-integrated-assessment-models-are-used-to-study-climate-change\">integrated assessment models</a> (IAMs), are projected pathways to lower or limit warming by the end of the century; examples of efforts to save “Big Civ”. </p>\n<p>For individuals and organizations, there are things that ‘make sense’ based on the forever continuation of “Big Civilization” (assuming you can do more than just survive): Building your retirement savings; Investing in skill-sets useful in a globalized economy, such as software engineering; buying urban property; mortgages, savings, banking services; assuming there will be someone to rent or sell your investment property to in the future; building your social media ‘brand’; out-sourcing as much as you can to the market (cleaning, cooking, maintenance, etc); buying stocks; setting businesses based on tourist dollars; and much more. This is not dependent on explicit reasoning; often it can simply be the linear extrapolation of how things are today.</p>\n<h4>Little Civilization</h4>\n<p>“Little Civ” is a mindset that springs from beliefs or assumptions such as 1) things will not last the way things are 2) Even if we started trying to turn things around, there might be a long period before we get things under control and return to our current levels of (uneven) prosperity 3) It is too late to truly turn things around. Again, this mindset does not have to be based on explicit reasoning, and does not need to be limited to climate issues. Arguably ‘preppers’ are the most well-known believers of the “Little Civ” mindset, without needing a shared civilization crisis they are all preparing for.</p>\n<p>Again, there are things that ‘make sense’ based on the risk or ‘inevitability’ that things are going to fall apart: developing food/water/power self-sufficiency; relying more on local economies; making emergency action plans for crisis moments; focusing social bonds in your immediate community; building up stocks of emergency supplies; taking resources out of the global economy and investing locally. Examples specifically from a climate perspective include: building sea walls to protect bays against rising water levels; moving housing away from flood/fire/storm areas; and numerous adaptions of the generic “Little Civ” </p>\n<p>So, the courses of action that individuals, communities and organizations will consider taking are shaped by their own orientations (explicit or not) around “Big Civ” and “Little Civ”. Additionally when considering collective action, sensible actors should also take into consideration the orientations of other actors; what mindsets are others bringing into their decision-making? To be explicit, if an collective action makes sense in one orientation but not another, it is an uphill struggle to get folks that hold different orientations to invest in the collective action; There needs to be some alignment on orientation for that to even be considered.</p>\n<p>Before moving on to some nuances though, I want to state some broad assertions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most of us (myself included) are currently anchoring our actions from a “Big Civ” orientation</li>\n<li>For that majority, considering “Little Civ” as an orientation can feel like facing death; the death of our world-view.</li>\n<li>This felt sense of ‘facing death’ can drive us to denial, with two common varieties: we build elaborate rationalizations for how the scientific consensus is either a hoax, wrong or not as bad as it seems; we acknowledge the consensus and then avoid reading about it or thinking about the future, often with background sense of gnawing dread.</li>\n<li>If “Little Civ” futures are possible, than this denial will stop us from preparing for them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t forget “Next Civilization”</p>\n<h6>How we arrive at a mix</h6>\n<p>For most of us, what mix of “Big Civ” and “Little Civ” orientation one carries comes down to our subconscious processing of risk, fear, community, and the narratives and tidbits of information we absorb through conversations and media (all medias: social, news, entertainment). While there will always be a subconscious processing aspect of our civilizational orientation, researching, gaining awareness and forming forecasts are ways we can be more explicit and precise about our orientation to “Big Civ” and “Little Civ” matters.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"We all know a change is coming"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Over the winter break, my partner and I took the time to expansively map out the factors and possibilities of the coming century.
