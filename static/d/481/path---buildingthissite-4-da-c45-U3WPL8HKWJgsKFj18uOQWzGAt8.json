And certainly not in the revisionist, retrograde fashion that some folk suggest. As intersectional feminism continues its push for multi-generational change in the roles and possibilities for women and equality for all, some men have been triggered by the uncertainty of change and the resetting of power dynamics. Operating under a scarcity mindset, from a place of fear and of understanding the world in zero-sum game terms (more for someone else, automatically means less for me), these men (and some women) yearn to return to ‘simpler’ times when gender roles were more or less fixed. I seek to articulate and build new masculinities (plural!), that adapt and integrate intersectional liberation of all people.</p>\n<h6>How humans get things done</h6>\n<p>This is probably my broadest topics, used as a catch all for my general fascination with how people come together, and how they get things done together.
