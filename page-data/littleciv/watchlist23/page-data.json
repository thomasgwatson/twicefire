I have also made some additions to the focus areas since 2023, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhanced Geothermal power production</li>\n<li>Artificial Intelligence developments</li>\n<li>Global supply chain disruption</li>\n<li>Ocean heat</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these things have become changed enough to warrant their own heading, instead of being lumped under another topic.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>How to read the watch-list</h3>\n<p>The bulk of the list focuses on interventions. These are actions and efforts that we can take to address the climate challenge. We probably need a strong mix of many of these interventions to be implemented to truly address the climate challenge but it is wise not to get too focused on any particular intervention; we might roll it out and find it does not produce the results we desire. As it currently stands, even if we hugely rolled out these intervention in the coming decade, we still face the risk that some climate related impacts will get worse before they get better. We are already seeing serious ecological degradation and flow on strain on human systems.</p>\n<p>The bottom part of the list are signals we should be paying attention to, in order to track the overall health of earth, from an ecological perspective. They provide gross (overall) feedback on planetary wide factors; we should still be very interested in impacts at more localized levels, particularly when evaluating and understanding interventions.</p>\n<p>The intention for the watch-list will be to continue to find good quality intervention/signal sources and continue periodically review progress (or otherwise) in the coming years. </p>\n<h5>The Watch List</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interventions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built-environment</li>\n<li>Clean Energy</li>\n<li>Societal Cost of Emissions</li>\n<li>Land-use</li>\n<li>Net Negative Emissions Techniques</li>\n<li>Human factors</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Signals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Global Metrics</li>\n<li>The Amazon</li>\n<li>Ice</li>\n<li>Ocean Health</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Built-environment <a name=\"built\"></a></h3>\n<p>Why:<br>\nThe built environment refers to the structures we live and work in. Globally, most of those structures are in cities; since 2007 the majority of humanity resides in cities, with that percentage continuing to increase. Emissions occur both in the construction of these buildings and then over their lifetime, primarily from heating/cooling and ventilation. Globally, most building in the next decade will occur in China, with India and Africa being the projected major building sites of the following two decades</p>\n<p>Summary:<br>\nOverall its slow progress in this matter. Six regions have adopted Zero Code; none of which reside in Asia or Africa (where we expect the bulk of buildings to be built in the coming decades). China has adopted some form of <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/policies/11635-technical-standard-for-nearly-zero-energy-buildings-gbt-51350-2019\">standard for low/zero energy building</a> but I have no current means to assess adoption. Some promising, ecologically-sound building materials cannot yet be included in low/no carbon building calculations because proper ways of accounting for them have not been accepted/agreed upon. Modular strawbale and/or mass timber walls could be great ways to lock carbon into buildings.</p>\n<p>What to watch in this domain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adoption of <a href=\"https://zero-code.org\">Zero Code</a></li>\n<li>In China</li>\n<li>In India</li>\n<li>In Africa</li>\n<li>In the rest of the world</li>\n<li>By the top multi-national architectural firms. <a href=\"https://architecture2030.org/\">Example of org pursing this</a></li>\n<li>Systems to account for carbon-capture potential for building materials like strawbale, mass timber construction and similar</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Indicator: Global level of green building adoption</p>\n<p>Tracked by: <a href=\"https://www.worldgbc.org/news-media\">Global Green Building Council Status Reports</a></p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1170px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b53af37a2fdd3010adb8e39c99959cdf/a412b/built.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"break\"\n        title=\"break\"\n        src=\"/static/b53af37a2fdd3010adb8e39c99959cdf/0e916/built.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b53af37a2fdd3010adb8e39c99959cdf/8c376/built.jpg 293w,\n/static/b53af37a2fdd3010adb8e39c99959cdf/34012/built.jpg 585w,\n/static/b53af37a2fdd3010adb8e39c99959cdf/0e916/built.jpg 1170w,\n/static/b53af37a2fdd3010adb8e39c99959cdf/a849f/built.jpg 1755w,\n/static/b53af37a2fdd3010adb8e39c99959cdf/2be76/built.jpg 2340w,\n/static/b53af37a2fdd3010adb8e39c99959cdf/a412b/built.jpg 3264w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h3>Clean Energy <a name=\"clean\"></a></h3>\n<p>Why:<br>\nAffordable/cheap energy underpins <em>everything</em> about how our society runs.

This change mainly stemmed from our land-use, through deforestation, urbanization, agriculture and grassland degradation. While the use of fossil fuels does dominate our imagery around the climate challenge, this impact from our relationship to the land (and ocean) is still very much with us. Restoration and changes in land-use do not mean removing human activity from ecological systems. There are many ways we can actively participate as stewards of ecological systems.</p>\n<p>Summary:<br>\nLimited progress to report. Which doesn’t mean this has been neutral, because the status quo for most of these areas has been heading in the negative direction. There is an effort to update the measurement methodology for “Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries” aka <a href=\"https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/what-redd\">REDD+</a>. This is needed because simplistic monocrop-big-volume-little-planning forest plantations are far too common and typically do not create lasting positive change.</p>\n<p>What to watch in this domain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reforestation/Afforestation</li>\n<li>Grasslands restoration</li>\n<li>Agricultural practices</li>\n<li>Soil ecology</li>\n<li>Mangroves/wetlands/marshlands restoration</li>\n<li>Return of land to indigenous stewardship (especially with subsequent climate focused funding)</li>\n<li>The UN’s “Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries” aka <a href=\"https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/what-redd\">REDD+</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Indicators: I don’t think there are globally recognised ways of comparing the level of regenerative land-use, especially between different types of ecologies. Even REDD+ has been critiqued and subsequently improved for there being a disconnect between metrics and impacts on the land.</p>\n<p>Tracked by: I do not currently have meta-review resources to track progress on this.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 1170px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/687d53588dbd5c4e0386919a0965fe67/a412b/land.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"break\"\n        title=\"break\"\n        src=\"/static/687d53588dbd5c4e0386919a0965fe67/0e916/land.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/687d53588dbd5c4e0386919a0965fe67/8c376/land.jpg 293w,\n/static/687d53588dbd5c4e0386919a0965fe67/34012/land.jpg 585w,\n/static/687d53588dbd5c4e0386919a0965fe67/0e916/land.jpg 1170w,\n/static/687d53588dbd5c4e0386919a0965fe67/a849f/land.jpg 1755w,\n/static/687d53588dbd5c4e0386919a0965fe67/2be76/land.jpg 2340w,\n/static/687d53588dbd5c4e0386919a0965fe67/a412b/land.jpg 3264w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h3>Net Negative Emissions Techniques <a name=\"net\"></a></h3>\n<p>Why:<br>\nThe reality is that if humans vanished from the face of the earth overnight, significant climate chaos is already locked into the future century.

The application of ground-up basalt to croplands has seen a promising initial study, suggesting that it absorbs a decent amount of carbon (even adjusting for energy inputs), and improves crop yields.

If they happen at a wide enough scale, they will end up having an impact on the climate challenge. </p>\n<p>Summary:<br>\nEach of these is distinct enough that I’ll address them individually below. Artificial Intelligence has reached a tipping point where it is going to start increasingly inserting itself into all things, so it is getting included. I added global supply chains because I should have included them previously.</p>\n<p>What to watch in this domain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Low or No Growth Policies and their Success/Failure</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The UK is kinda of doing this, maybe by accident? I do not think these sorts of policies have been adopted officially anywhere, so little to report.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Global Access to Birth Control and Education For Women</p>\n<ul>\n<li>These are causally linked to falling birth rates. Across the globe, they are generally plummeting, with many ‘advanced’ economies struggling to make population replacement rate (2.1 kids per couple). South Korea is below 1! Japan and South Korea are the places to watch, to see how these demographic changes play out.</li>\n<li>On one hand, the global drop in birth-rates takes some of the heat out of the overconsumption of rich societies. But on the other hand, it will likely lead to difficult societal dynamics. Older generations will be less invested in the wellbeing of younger generations and the future in general, limiting societal resilience.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Disaster/Pandemic/Famine Preparation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>LOL, how did that go?</li>\n<li>Covid has been informative; many societies struggled to act in cohesive and agile ways about how to manage the pandemic (certainly a very difficult task). The covid19 pandemic has weakened most societies ability to deal with pandemics; societial trust in public health institutions is rattled in many places, health-systems have been stretched and degraded, and a small subset of the population are now more vulnerable to subsequent pandemics. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conflict</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The growing cold-war between the USA et al and China does not bode well for global stability, or cohesive climate coordination.</li>\n<li>I do not read the recent uptick in open-warfare in the Russian invasion of Ukraine to be related to climate induced scarcity or the like but the widening of the conflict has shifted global geopolitics to a more openly adversarial phase.</li>\n<li>NATO is so back. Putin’s has single-handedly revived the purpose of NATO, resolidifying the alliance. No more peace-dividend, unfortunately, as the fear of conflict increases.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AI developments</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AI is incredibly ‘frothy’ right now. Lots of advances in some sectors of the field are breaking into mass awareness.</li>\n<li>No direct impact on climate matters right now but the AI will seep into every other field and attempt to disrupt</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Global supply-chain disruption</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The covid19 pandemic certainly got the global supply chain fairly wonky but it is a resilient beast. I do expect to see it put under increasing pressure over the decades, from both climate chaos and China/USA friction. However, news of its pending demise are greatly exaggerated.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tracked by: I do not currently have meta-review resources to track progress on this.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 32px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/518bcb7b2b6c3d418f39962492f9eac8/62dc3/icon.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"break\"\n        title=\"break\"\n        src=\"/static/518bcb7b2b6c3d418f39962492f9eac8/62dc3/icon.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/518bcb7b2b6c3d418f39962492f9eac8/62dc3/icon.jpg 32w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 32px) 100vw, 32px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<h2>Global Signals</h2>\n<p>Why:<br>\nGlobal signals are more about keeping track of the impacts of climate change.

Unfortunately, as I type this, media reports of expansive fires and further attacks on communities indigenous to the Amazon are trickling out of Brazil.</p>\n<p>What to watch in this domain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Deforestation</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deforestation in the Amazon trended down from the mid-2000s to 2012 and have been steadily rising since then.

Sea-ice and surface ice both contribute to high albedo earth surfaces, better at reflecting the radiative energy of the sun (consequently, the more of it we lose, the faster the earth will heat up).
