This watch list is my attempt at that longer view. The watch list’s goal is to be a list of big-impact interventions and signals pertaining to the climate challenge, ideally with indicators for their state and a link to someone/something that is tracking that state at consistent intervals. It should be something I can come back to periodically to get a recap of the biggest trackable climate chaos factors, with some consistency of comparison from year to year. Without a watch list, it will be too easy for me (or anyone for that matter) to get lost in the weeds and tumble of ad-hoc climate reporting, and my daily life &#x26; responsibilities. Why do folks get lost and struggle to direct their actions and thinking about climate matters?</p>\n<p><img src=\"/bg2-98cc8c6ef3c38275846f2521e6f518ef.jpg\" alt=\"break\"></p>\n<p>Without too much effort, one can find a lot of news updates or commentaries on climate related matters, even if the ‘main-stream media’ is still somewhat inept at covering climate issues. There is, however, several challenges to getting to a place of insight around the climate challenge. To start, climate science commentary/news media is a heavily contested or adversarial information environment. There has been a significant amount of money, and then political influence poured into sowing fear, uncertainty and doubt about science pertaining to climate matters, mainly on the denialist side. Even within those that recognise human-caused climate change, there are clashing narratives on how it is currently and will in the future play out. Part of those narratives includes certain types of environment aesthetic that can get in the way of insight: when climate actions or lifestyles have to look a certain way to be environmentally sound/regenerative/sustainable, we can lose effective interventions or measures to get us closer to climate stability. The other great ‘noise’ in all the climate ‘signal’ are climate/weather/natural disasters and problems, presented without reliable baselines of activity. If a terrible storm system hits a coastal town, is it or isn’t it related to climate chaos? Without a contextual depth to the reporting, about storm frequencies and distributions, we are left in uneasy uncertainly about whether a ‘news’ event should update our understanding of the state of the environment.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 32px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/518bcb7b2b6c3d418f39962492f9eac8/62dc3/icon.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"break\"\n        title=\"break\"\n        src=\"/static/518bcb7b2b6c3d418f39962492f9eac8/62dc3/icon.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/518bcb7b2b6c3d418f39962492f9eac8/62dc3/icon.jpg 32w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 32px) 100vw, 32px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This general state of confusion, uncertainly and the difficult narratives that surround the climate challenge makes effective and coordinated action difficult. This watch list is my own attempt to overcome that for my decision making; Perhaps it will be useful for others. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This list is not in any order, and will be my running best estimate for the top factors we ought to be tracking to have a strategic view of the climate challenge. No single individual or organization should pretend or attempt to work on all of these areas. The challenge space is so large and varied however, that we should actively support a range of interventions and efforts to address the climate challenge. While individuals and organizations should probably focus on solving one or few parts of the challenge, claims that there is a silver bullet solution or one intervention that everyone needs to do are naive; considering the situation we have put ourselves in, we are going to need a lot of changes in how we steward the earth.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>How to read the watch-list</h3>\n<p>The bulk of the list focuses on interventions. These are actions and efforts that we can take to address the climate challenge. We probably need a strong mix of many of these interventions to be implemented to truly address the climate challenge but it is wise not to get too focused on any particular intervention; we might roll it out and find it does not produce the results we desire. As it currently stands, even if we hugely rolled out these intervention in the coming decade, we still face the risk that some climate related impacts will get worse before they get better. We are already seeing serious ecological degradation and flow on strain on human systems.</p>\n<p>The bottom part of the list are signals we should be paying attention to, in order to track the overall health of earth, from an ecological perspective. They provide gross (overall) feedback on planetary wide factors; we should still be very interested in impacts at more localized levels, particularly when evaluating and understanding interventions.</p>\n<p>The intention for the watch-list will be to continue to find good quality intervention/signal sources and continue periodically review progress (or otherwise) in the coming years. And to ultimately have that <a href=\"https://twicefire.com/littleciv/littleciv/\">inform forecast updates.</a></p>\n<h5>The Watch List</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Interventions</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Built-environment</li>\n<li>Clean Energy</li>\n<li>Societal Cost of Emissions</li>\n<li>Land-use</li>\n<li>Net Negative Emissions Techniques</li>\n<li>Human factors</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Signals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Global Metrics</li>\n<li>The Amazon</li>\n<li>Ice</li>\n<li>Ocean Health</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Built-environment <a name=\"built\"></a></h3>\n<p>The built environment refers to the structures we live and work in.

There has been a significant amount of money, and then political influence poured into sowing fear, uncertainty and doubt about science pertaining to climate matters, mainly on the denialist side. Even within those that recognise human-caused climate change, there are clashing narratives on how it is currently and will in the future play out. Part of those narratives includes certain types of environment aesthetic that can get in the way of insight: when climate actions or lifestyles have to look a certain way to be environmentally sound/regenerative/sustainable, we can lose effective interventions or measures to get us closer to climate stability.
