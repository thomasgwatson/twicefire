Did I comment on a facet in one place but it is missing elsewhere (don’t fall into the trap of feeling like you have to touch on EVERY topic in every time chunk)? Are there key assertions that one should question or research? Are there easy links or references to add to source material?</p>\n<h5>Fifth: Profit!</h5>\n<p>You’ve just created a snapshot of your sense-making! This is its own separate process that you can then plug into something else you are doing or want to do. What are some ways you can build off this?</p>\n<p><strong>Reflection and learning;</strong> treat this like a particularly structured journal piece. Come back to it and reflect on how your sense-making in the past didn’t end up making sense or really did! Remember, we can only make sense of the world with the views and information we hold at the time, be gentle.</p>\n<p><strong>Forecasting question generation;</strong> Generate sets of forecasting questions that are related to these interleaving domains but that are targeted, somewhat measurable and time specific. Then you can run your own forecasting exercise (I know everyone’s dream, right?).</p>\n<p><strong>Make decisions based on your sense-making;</strong> Don’t forget, you are defacto doing this anyway ;) If you are considering big decisions, best to add some rigor to all this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Key assertions need extra attention, try to reference/vet all of them</li>\n<li>Add a few forecasts for each time-chunk, to keep you honest as time progresses</li>\n<li>Identify how your decision making would be impacted by different branching through the time-chunks</li>\n<li>Figure out what decisions you might need to make, and how changes in conditions will make them necessary, redundant or otherwise influence them.</li>\n<li>If any of these decisions require some legwork or preparation, include that in your writeup</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hopefully I’ll have a real-life example to show off shortly!</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 32px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/518bcb7b2b6c3d418f39962492f9eac8/62dc3/icon.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"break\"\n        title=\"break\"\n        src=\"/static/518bcb7b2b6c3d418f39962492f9eac8/62dc3/icon.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/518bcb7b2b6c3d418f39962492f9eac8/62dc3/icon.jpg 32w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 32px) 100vw, 32px\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Got a lot on your mind about how things might pan out in the future?
