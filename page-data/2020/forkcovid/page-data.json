This depends on whether tests per day capacity is sufficient (for USA 750,000 was the reference number), whether sufficient public health monitoring is in place and whether folks have signed up to the mobile phone tracking programs.</li>\n<li>Another factor is how much California (particularly health-care workers) will be able to help other USA regions that are in corona-hell, and whether this strains Californian capability.
